<h1>CHANGE LOG</h1>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
On or around <strong>Aug 12th, 2025</strong>: The hindcast period of SEAS51_iri2 has been extended until 2022; the available period is now 1981–2022.

<li style="text-align: justify;">
On or around <strong>May 26th, 2025</strong>: it was brought to our attention that the SEAS51_Y180 dataset uses 
a longitude X grid ranging from 0.5 to 359.5, not 0 to 360 as previously indicated. A new version, 
named SEAS51_iri2, has been created to correct this issue. The older version is still available at 
it's original location, but its link has been hidden from the dataset page to discourage new users 
from accessing it

<li style="text-align: justify;">
On or around <strong>August 26th 2024</strong>: it was brought to our attention that SEAS51 latitude Y
grid never was 181 points from 90˚S to 90˚N, like SEAS5 was, but 180 points from
89.5˚S to 89.5˚N. This means that the version of the dataset so far was putting 0s at
Y=90˚S all across the other dimensions and that all the variables were shifted by a
half degree compared to what it was meant to be. A new version named SEAS51_Y180 is
correcting this mistake. The older version remains but its link has been hidden from
the dataset page to discourage new users from using it. It's available at the same
address as it always has been,
