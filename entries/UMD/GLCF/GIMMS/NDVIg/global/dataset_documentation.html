<b>Overview</b><br>
The GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies) data set is a normalizeed difference vegetation index (NDVI) product available for a 25 year period spanning from 1981 to 2006.  The data set is derived from imagery obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument onboard the NOAA satellite series 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 17.  This is an NDVI dataset that has been corrected for calibration, view geometry, volcanic aerosols, and other effects not related to vegetation change.
<p>
The current release of this data set, added to the Data Library on 06 August 2010, contains NDVIg data on a global geographic projection (evenly spaced in latitude and longitude) for the period July 1981 to December 2006.  The previous release of this data set in the Data Library included the period July 1981 to December 2003.  For each gridpoint there are two values per month, the maximum NDVI value for the first fifteen days of the month, and the maximum value for the remainder of the month.  Please see the documentation indicated above for more details.
