<H2>Summary:</H2>
The Global Monthly River Discharge Data Set contains monthly averaged
discharge measurements for 1018 stations located throughout the world.  The 
period of record varies widely from station to station with a mean of 21.5
years.  The data are derived from the published UNESCO archives for river
discharge and checked against information obtained  from the Global
Runoff Center in Koblenz, Germany, through the U.S. National Geophysical
Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

    <DT><H3><A NAME="1.2">  Data Set Introduction:</A></H3>
    <DD>The Global Monthly River Discharge Data Set (RivDIS v1.1) contains 
monthly averaged measurements of river discharge from stations located
throughout the world.  These data were compiled predominately from published 
UNESCO  archives and checked using data from the Global Runoff Data Center in
Koblenz, Germany.  Monthly averaged river discharge and associated stations 
characteristics are included in the data set.
Station level data summaries are available.
    <DT><H3><A NAME="1.3">  Objective/Purpose:</A></H3>
    <DD>The purpose of the data set is to provide discharge measurements 
contained in the UNESCO archives in a digital format that can be easily
acquired and analyzed by researchers and planners in the water sciences 
community.  From this information, areally-distributed runoff can be estimated
and used to validate climate and biogeochemistry models that simulate components
of the terrestrial water cycle.

    <DD>Monthly measurements of river discharge are available for 1018
stations representing six continents and 114 countries.  The period of
record varies widely from station to station with a mean of 21.5 years.

    <DD>A subset of these data (RivDIS v1.0), representing 949 stations, 
was published in 1996 by UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme

<DT><H2>3.<A NAME="3.">  Theory of Measurements:</A></H2> 
    <DD>No specific information is given in the original sources.  Typically,
river discharge is measured through the use of a rating curve that relates 
local water level height to water flow.  This rating curve is used to 
estimate discharge from the observed water level.  The rating curves are 
periodically rechecked and recalibrated through on-site measurement of
discharge and river stage.

segments depicting the world's river systems using a geographic information
system (GIS).  Contributing areas, discharges, and runoff were also checked 
by comparing the reported values to those calculated by the GIS and a 
simulated network topology at 30-minute spatial resolution.
<P>
The measurement data were also reviewed.  When published reports were 
available, an independent comparison was made between the keypunched entries 
and the published values.  The computed runoff values were examined for
extreme or unreasonable values.  Time series plots of the discharge data 
were reviewed to identify outliers.  The discovery of any inconsistencies
were grounds for a more careful analysis of suspect sites and measurements.

          <DT><H3><A NAME="10.2.2">  Confidence Level/Accuracy 
             Judgment:</A></H3>
          <DD>The accuracy of the measurements is not given in the 
original sources.  However, river gauging is generally thought to have 
an accuracy of 5-10% but the actual accuracy depends significantly on 
local conditions (Dingman 1994).

          <DD>UNH supplied the data to the DAAC as an Access database.
The DAAC extracted ASCII files from this database, loaded these files
into SAS, and  generated station summaries.  These summaries were compared
to similar summaries published in Vorosmarty et al. (1996a) to ensure the
integrity of the data.

<DT><H2>12.<A NAME="12.">  Application of the Data Set:</A></H2>
     <DD>The Global Monthly River Discharge data set will be useful in 
a variety of earth systems science and water resource planning 
applications.  Owing to the strong dependence of terrestrial productivity 
and nutrient biogeochemistry on water availability and fluxes, this data 
set will assist in the calibration and validation of associated computed 
water budgets when integrated over contributing watershed areas.  A 
similar integration will provide support to global and regional 
atmospheric modeling studies with respect to simulated land surface 
hydrology.  The data set can be used to support water resource 
assessments, both in terms of climatology, inter- and intra-annual 
variability, and progressive climate change.  As an example, this data 
set was used to quantify the impact of large reservoir systems on the 
global network of rivers (Vorosmarty et al. 1997a; 1997b).  Temporal 
patterns of river discharge also regulate habitat, biodiversity, and 
nutrient biogeochemistry in aquatic ecosystems.  Fluxes of water are 
closely connected to the transport of sediment and dissolved constituents 
through river systems, and these are necessary to better quantify the 
linkage of the continental land masses and the world's oceans.
