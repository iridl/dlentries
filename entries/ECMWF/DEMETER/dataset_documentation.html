<center><b>WARNING (20/5/2005)</b></center>
<br>On 6/5/2004 we discovered that the data of the Met Office coupled model hindcast (GloSea) started in February 1968 were corrupted. The experiment has been rerun and the correct data are already available. If you have downloaded the data previously to that date, we strongly encourage you to retrieve them again.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> These corrected data were included in the Data Library entry on 27 June 2005.
<p>
Please see the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/research/demeter/data/index.html">DEMETER data dissemination website</a> for any additional data warnings.
