/note (GloSea5-GC2 global seasonal prediction system which is developed at the Met Office. A Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter scheme (SKEB) was used to generate spread between members initialized from the same analysis. Four ensemble members initialized every day in the cast of the forecast – two run for 75 days and two for 240 days. Hindcast (historical re-forecasts) covers the period 1991~2010 and 3 members initialized on fixed calendar dates – 1st, 9th, 17th and 25th.) def
