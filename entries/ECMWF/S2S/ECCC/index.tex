/note (Global ensemble prediction system with initial conditions generated with the Ensemble Kalman Filter which receives observations that are background-checked and bias-corrected by the ECCC Global Deterministic Prediction System. Different members have different model configuration perturbations (multi-parametrization physics). GEPS, which has 21 members, is extended to day 32 once a week (Thursday at 00Z).) def
