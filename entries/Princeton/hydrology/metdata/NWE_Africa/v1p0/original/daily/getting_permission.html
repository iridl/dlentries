<h2>Getting permission to access High Resolution Daily Meteorological Data for northern/west/east Africa data from the Terrestrial Hydrology Research Group at Princeton University<br>
</h2>
The protocol to register at Princeton to request access to this dataset is broken. We have tried but have not managed to reach someone at Princeton who could propose another protocol. As a result, we can not grant access to this dataset. Should you really want to access it, we recommend that you find someone at Princeton who can tell us how to proceed to grant or deny requests.
