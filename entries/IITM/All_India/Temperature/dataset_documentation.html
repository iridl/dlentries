<p>
Data Description:
<p>
        The network selected to work out these regional means of maximum and
 <br>       minimum temperatures consists of 121 uniformly distributed 
<br>        stations for which temperature data are available from 1901. Adequate
<br>        care has been taken to ensure that the data are homogeneous and free
<br>        from changes in observational procedures.  All-India and six regional
<br>        means of the temperatures have been worked out by computing the
<br>        arithmetic means of the data at stations comprising the region.
<br>        The regions have been delineated based on their distinct climatic and
<br>        geographical settings.
