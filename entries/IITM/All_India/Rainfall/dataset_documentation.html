Primary Data Source:
<p>
       India Meteorological Department
<p>
Data Period:
<p>
<br>        1871-2001
<p>
Data Description:
<p>
        Network of  rain-gauge stations:
<p>
        While selecting the network of rain-gauge stations, an 
<br>        effort was made to select a network which would provide one 
<br>        representative station per district having a reliable record 
<br>        for the longest possible period. The network selected under 
<br>        these constraints consist of 306 almost uniformly distributed 
<br>        stations for which rainfall data are available from 1871. The 
<br>        hilly regions consisting of four meteorological subdivisions 
<br>        of India which are parallel to Himalayan mountain range have 
<br>        not been considered in view of the meagre  rain-gauge  network 
<br>        and low areal representation of a rain-gauge in a hilly area. 
<br>        Two island subdivisions far away from mainland have also not 
<br>        been included. Thus, the contiguous area having network of 306 
<br>        stations over 29 meteorological subdivisions measures about 
<br>        2,880,000 sq.km., which is about 90 percent of the total area 
<br>        of the country.     
<p>
        Preparation of Subdivisional/Regional rainfall series
<p>
        The monthly (January - December) area  weighted rainfall 
<br>        series for each of the 29 meteorological subdivisions have 
<br>        been prepared by assigning the district area as the weight for 
<br>        each rain-gauge station in that subdivision. Similarly assigning 
<br>        the subdivision area as the weight to each of the subdivisions in
<br>        the region, area weighted monthly rainfall series are prepared for
<br>        Homogeneous regions of India as well as for all India.
<p>
        IMPORTANT NOTE:
<p>
        The data for the recent period 1991-2001 are preliminary estimates
<br>        based on the subdivisional means supplied by the India Meteorlogical
<br>        Department (IMD), which are in turn based on a variable network.
<br>        However, the IMD data have been rescaled to conform to the long-term
<br>        means of the respective subdivisions in the IITM-IMR data set.  These
<br>        data will be updated as and when the full set of data for 306 stations
<br>        becomes available.
