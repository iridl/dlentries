 /note (IMPORTANT NOTE:  As of 24 April 2015, all daily CHIRPS 2.0 data from year 2000 onward available in the Data Library were removed and new data requests for that period will access data reprocessed by the UCSB Climate Hazards Group.  The reprocessing corrects a problem found in daily CHIRPS for the CPC-IR time period, 2000 – present.  There was a problem creating the daily percent cold cloud duration (percent CCD) map used in the downscaling. Places with missing IR data were set to zero instead of missing. Anywhere this happened, the precipitation was set to zero. This was always a problem for Eastern Australia/Indonesia/Japan, where a gap between two geostationary satellites exists. There were a small number of times this problem occurred outside of these particular areas.) def
