This is a collection of quality-controlled monthly data from over 8000 weather stations
    located around the world.  The data is available here as a <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.GCPS/.MONTHLY/.STATION/">dataset</a>, including an interactive data viewer and downloadable data files.
<p>

This dataset is quality controlled with respect to time and space and
is derived from the Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN).  The
GHCN is modified by performing reproducible quality control procedures
both temporally and spatially and by updating the dataset on a
seasonal basis with MCDW data.  This dataset contains absolute
temperature and precipitation with quality control flags.
Descriptions of the quality control procedure and flags are included
with the data.
