<h1>NOAA Baseline Climatological Dataset - Monthly Gridded Temperature
      and Precipitation Anomaly Data</h1>

The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.GCPS/.MONTHLY/.GRIDDED/">here</a>.
<p>
This dataset is quality controlled with respect to time and space and is derived from the
Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN).  The GHCN is modified by 
performing reproducible quality control procedures both temporally and spatially and by
updating the dataset on a seasonal basis with MCDW data.  All of the data used to
grid had to pass both quality control procedures.
