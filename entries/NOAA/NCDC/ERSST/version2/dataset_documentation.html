Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures, version 2 (ERSST.v2), beginning January
1854.

ERSST.v2 is an improved extended reconstruction of SST.  In both version 1 and version 2 
the high-frequency SST anomalies are reconstructed by fitting to a set of spatial modes.  
In version 1 anomaly increments are reconstructed using anomaly increment modes.  In 
version 2 anomalies are reconstructed using anomaly modes.  In regions where variance is 
relatively large the two are comparable, but version 2 better analyzes the anomalies in 
regions where the variance is low.  In addition, version 2 also uses sea-ice concentrations
to improve the high-latitude SST analysis, and a modified historical bias correction for 
the 1939-1941 period. Version 2 also includes an improved error estimate.


Data are available in this directory. All fields were computed on the 2-degree grid. The 
grid has 180 zonal points on 0E, 2E, ..., 358E, and 89 meridional points on 88S, 86S, ..., 
88N.  Over land a value of -99.99 is assigned.  In addition any SST mean value less than 
-1.8C was set to -1.8C.
