<h1>Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily, V1.0 (DSI-9300)</h1> 
<p>
The following description is from the abstract of the documentation file for this data set:
<p>
<i>Abstract: The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) - Daily represents a compilation 
of global daily data into a single and consistent format. This dataset is a continuation of the 
Global Daily Climatology Network (GDCN, TD9101) which is no longer under development.
The data set will serve the needs of researchers, weather-sensitive businesses, agriculture,
and policy makers whose are dependent upon complete and accurate analysis of daily temperature
and precipitation. Data within the GHCN-Daily have been extensively checked through a series
of quality control procedures to ensure erroneous values have been removed and/or identified.

<b><u>COUNTRY CODES (Country_Code)</u></b>

<b><u>DATA MEASUREMENT FLAG (DMFlag-Pr, DMFlag-Tx, DMFlag-Tn)</u></b>
<p>(Note:  Flags can apply to Tx = Maximum Temperature, Tn = Minimum Temperature, Pr = Total Precipitation)

It is possible that one or more quality control flags may apply to a single datum.  Therefore,
the above listed flags are listed in order of precedence.  Thus, if a value is a streak (e.g. 
'75') and also an outlier (e.g. '79') then the '75' flag will be set for that datum.  Once
a value has a non-blank quality control flag, that datum is excluded from subsequent quality
control procedures.
<p>
<b><u>DUPLICATE STATIONS</u></b>
<p>
With millions of days of daily data, direct comparison of all station data to all other 
station data was not feasible due to computational time limitations.  However, a station to 
station duplicate identification check was developed that compares the 15th day (for all years)
of each month to the 15th day of each corresponding month. The comparison was only done 
between the same element (e.g. compare STN A TMIN to STN B TMIN). The purpose of this test
is to identify potential station pairs that have 100% of the same data on the 15th
day of each month for all non-missing days. The test requires that at least 60 comparisons 
(12 months x 5 years) of data are present before a duplicate can be declared. <a href="http://iri.columbia.edu/~mbell/DataLibrary/GHCN_Daily/AppendixF.txt">Appendix F</a>
lists the station pairs and the element that are potentially duplicated.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> A portion of the stations were given new id numbers to facilitate their
entry into the Data Library.  A list of these stations, along with their original and
new id numbers, can be found <a
