ABSTRACT:
Summer half-year (April-September) mean temperatures are reconstructed across 
western North America between 1600 and 1982. The reconstructions, ultimately 
in the form of gridpoint anomaly time series, are produced using a 
principal-components regression technique to relate variability in a network of 
up to 53 high-elevation maximum latewood-density chronologies to a number of 
important temperature principal-component amplitude series. The reconstructions 
are of good quality over the area between 35° and 55°N but are subject to large 
uncertainty north of 55°N, particularly prior to 1750. Four regional time series, 
the average of between two and six gridpoint series - British Columbia and 
the Pacific Northwest, California, eastern Rockies and northern High Plains, 
and the Southwest deserts - plus one more-extensive western United States series 
are presented and described. Examples of individual-year and decadal-mean anomaly 
maps are illustrated, and the results of preliminary spectral analyses of the 
regional time series are described. 



DESCRIPTION: 
Reconstructions of summer temperatures at each of 24 grid point locations in the 
western U.S. and five regional reconstructions. As the 53-site reconstructions are 
better than those from the 23 sites a 1600-1982 series for any region should be 
derived from the 23 site reconstruction for 1600-1749 and the 53 site one for 1750-1982.

°C anomalies relative to the 1951-70 base period.
