The <a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.USHCN/">U.S. Historical Climatology Network</a> (USHCN, Karl et al. 1990) is a
                high-quality moderate sized data set of monthly averaged maximum,
                minimum, and mean temperature and total monthly precipitation developed to
                assist in the detection of regional climate change. 
<p>
The Areal edited (<b>raw</b>) data is the original (or raw) data that have been screened to flag
monthly data that are suspect/outliers (over 3 standard deviations from period of
record mean of the element).  Note that the outliers are only flagged:
they are still present in the data.
<p>
The Time of Observation data (<b>tos</b>) is the Areal Edited data that have been adjusted to
remove the time of observation bias so that the data will be consistent with a
midnight-to-midnight observation schedule.
<p>
The Filnet data (<b>filnet</b>) is the Time of Observation data that have been adjusted for the
Maximum/Minimum Temperature System (MMTS) bias, station moves/changes bias, and
contains estimated values for missing/outlier data.
<p>
The Urban Adjusted data (<b>urban</b>) is the Filnet data that have been adjusted for bias due to
urbanization effects.
<p> The Confidence factor data (<b>cfv</b>) is a measure
of data quality.
