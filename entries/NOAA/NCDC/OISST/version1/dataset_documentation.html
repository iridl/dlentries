<h1>NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily Sea Surface Temperature 
Analysis</h1>
<p>
The Daily sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is computed daily on a 0.25 degree latitude/longitude grid. 
This is version 1.0. There are two products with different satellite data. 
Both products use in situ data from ships and buoys. Also SSTs are generated 
for sea-ice concentrations above 50%. The sea ice for 1985-2004 is from 
<a href="http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051.html"> 
the National Snow and Ice Data Center </a>. The sea ice from 2005 to 
present is from <a href="http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/seaice/"> 
the Polar and Great Lakes Ice group of NCEP</a>.
<p>
The first product uses  
<a href="http://pathfinder.nodc.noaa.gov"> 
NODC's AVHRR Pathfinder Version 5 </a>
for January 3, 1985 though December 31, 2005 and the operational US Navy AVHRR 
data  from January 1, 2006, through present. 
This product will henceforth be referred to as the AVHRR product.
<p>
The second product adds AMSR-E version 5 data obtained from 
<a href="http://www.remss.com/">
Remote Sensing Systems </a>
along with the AVHRR data used in version 1a and is available from June 1, 
2002, (the start of AMSR-E) through present. This product will henceforth be 
termed the AVHRR + AMSR product.
<p>
Both analyses include a bias correction of the satellite data with respect to 
in situ data using an empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) algorithm.
A description of the complete analysis procedure can be found in 
the paper by <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/sst/papers/daily-sst.pdf">
Reynolds et. al (2007) </a>.
<p>
The SST analyses contains 4 fields: SST, SST anomaly, estimated error 
standard deviation of analysed SST, and sea ice concentration.
