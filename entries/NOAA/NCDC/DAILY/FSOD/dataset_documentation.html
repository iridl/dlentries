STATION-ID
This eight-digit numeric identifier (WBAN STATION NUMBER) is assigned by the
National Climatic Data Center.  The first 3 digits are zero's.  WBAN NUMBER is a
5 digit number formulated to designate the station.  A list of stations with
their  coordinates, elevation and period of record is available upon request.
Values range from 00000001 through 00099999.

METEOROLOGICAL ELEMENT-TYPE
The type of meteorological element stored in this record is given as a 4-
Character alphanumeric acronym.  The following list denotes the specific
elements contained in TD-3210.  To determine which units are used for each
element-type you must read Tape Field 004 "Element-Units" (Reference Table "A").

ASMM
Average Cloudiness Midnight to Midnight (begin September 1992 for ASOS sites).
This is the average of all available 30-second ceilometer data for the 24-hour
period expressed in tenths of cloud cover at or below 12,000 feet.  The DATA-
VALUES are defined in Reference Table ?D?.

ASSS
Average Cloudiness Sunrise to Sunset (begin September 1992 for ASOS sites).
This is the average of all available 30-second ceilometer data for the period
from sunrise to sunset expressed in tenths of cloud cover at or below  12,000
feet.  The DATA-VALUES are defined in Reference Table ?D?.

AWND
Average Daily Wind Speed (begin 1984).  Units expressed in miles per hour to
tenths.  From January 1984 through June 1987 the Element Unit is incorrectly
listed as TK (Tenths of Knots), it should be MH (Miles per Hour).

CLDG

DPNT
Departure from Normal Temperature. DATA-VALUE = -00099 to b00099 degrees
Fahrenheit.

DPTP
Average Daily Dew-Point Temperature (begin  1984).  Units  expressed in tenths
of degrees Fahrenheit.

DYSW
Daily Occurrence of WEATHER. These two digit DYSW element codes are stored in
the rightmost four digits of the VALUE portion of the DATA-VALUE field.  Within
the four digits used, the weather codes are entered left justified.  Thus, if
one type of weather occurs during a day the VALUE field would appear as OXXOO
where XX is the appropriate weather code.  If two types of weather occur the
VALUE field will contain OXXYY where XX is value 1 and YY is value 2.  If more
than 2 types of weather occur on the same day, they will be stored in additional
DYSW records as needed. (Reference Table "A1")

DYVC
Day with Weather in the Vicinity (begin July 1996). The present (or prevailing)
weather occurring at the time of the observation in the vicinity of the station,
between 5 and 10 statute miles of the point of observation.

NOTE: This element is used beginning July 1996 and is coded in the same manner
as the element DYSW.  See the description for DYSW for details. (Reference Table
"A1")

peak reached by the pen of the gust recorder  during the 24 hour period.
Direction is expressed in 16 Point  WBAN Code (Reference Table "B1"). Speed
generally expressed in miles per hour.  When two or more equal wind speeds occur
the most recent is archived.

FSMI
Fastest Mile Wind Direction and Speed.  Recorded by stations  having triple or
multiple register type recording instruments.  The speed of a mile of wind
occurring in the shortest time is used.  This is determined by measuring the
jogs on the chart made by the one mile contacts of the anemometer.  Direction is
expressed in 16 Point WBAN Code.  Speed expressed in miles per hour.  Example of
value field XXYYY for wind direction and speed:  18045; 18 = wind direction from
169 degrees to 191 degrees.  045 = wind speed 45 miles per hour. FSMI is not
digitized for Air Weather Service stations.  (Reference Table "B1")

FSMN
Fastest Observed One-minute Wind Direction and Speed.  This is used at stations
not equipped with recording instruments.  It is obtained by observation of an
indicator for one minute and using an average value.  Direction is expressed in
Tens of Degrees Code.  Speed expressed in miles per hour.  Example of value
field XXYYY for wind direction and speed:  18045; 18 = wind direction from 169
degrees to 191 degrees.  045 = wind speed 45 miles per hour.  FSMN is not
digitized for Air Weather Service Stations. (Reference table "C")

expressed in hours and minutes. Example: 2359 = 23 hours and 59 minutes.

PKGS
Peak Gust Direction and Speed.  If two or more equal peak gust speeds occurred
on the same day, the first was digitized for the period July, 1968 through
December 1972.  Beginning in January 1973, the last was digitized.  The
direction is generally expressed in 16 Point WBAN Code, with the following
exceptions:

(1)  Air Force stations used 36 Point code from January, 1964 through February,
1967, 16 Point WBAN Code from March, 1967 through June, 1968, and 36 Point code
again from July, 1968 through December, 1970.  Air Force data was generally
discontinued by December, 1970.

(2)  Navy stations used 16 Point WBAN Code from the beginning of record through
January, 1971, and 36 Point Code from February, 1971 through the present.

Wind speeds are generally expressed in miles per hour through December,  1954,
and in knots from January, 1955 to the present.  A  consistent exception is Navy
stations, which used knots for the entire period of record.  Example of value
field XXYYY after 1954 for wind direction and speed:  44032; 44 = Wind direction
from the SE.  032 = Wind speed 032 knots.

15.  Known Uncorrected Problems:

There are known TD-3210 problems.  Those problems are being addressed by a
program VaLHiDD (Validation of Historical Daily Data).

During the period 1984-86 there are numerous entries for element PRCP of "NA"
for the meteorological Element Units Code.  These should be coded as "HI".

In 1988 for states 31-91 (North Carolina to Pacific Islands), the algebraic sign
of positive meteorological data values may be coded as "+" symbols instead of as
blanks.

The historical data were converted from existing digital files and placed in the
element structure format in 1983.  At that time these data were only processed
through a gross value check.  In January 1984, NCDC instituted  greatly enhanced
computer algorithms for automated validation of digital archives.  The revised
edit system performs internal consistency checks, climatological limits checks
and serial checks.  It is the goal of the NCDC that, as resources permit, these
historical files will be brought up to the same level of quality as those from
1984 onward.

Quality control "flags" are appended to each element to show how they fared
during the edit procedures and to indicate what, if any, action was taken.  The
files consist of observed values and, as necessary, edited values.  Flags must
be checked at all times to determine if an edited value is present.

The typical progression of temperature instruments was from liquid-in-glass
thermometers, to (1960 series) Hygrothermometers, to (1980 series)
Hygrothermometers.  Scientists are currently investigating the effect these
instrument changes (especially the 1980 series) may have on long term
temperature records.

Inventories of the TD-3210 data set are available which indicate missing data
periods by station for most elements.

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM TEMPERATURE

National Weather Service, and Federal Aviation Stations:  These values are
determined from stations equipped with maximum and minimum thermometers or
recording instruments.  For some sites, when instruments were inoperative,
values were  selected from hourly observations.

U.S. Air Force Stations:  From May 15, 1955, for stations taking 24 record
observations per day, the maximum and minimun temperatures are determined from
hourly observations.  The observations at the beginning and ending of day are
considered.  The values are reported as missing when more than 3 of the hourly
observations pertinent to the determination of maximum and minimum temperatures
for each 24-hour period are missing or erroneous.

U.S. Navy Stations:  When maximum and minimum thermometer readings are not
available, the data at most stations are reported as missing.  Some Navy
stations determine the maximum and minimum temperatures from hourly observations
when readings from maximum and minimum thermometers are not available.

Hail and Snowfall Amounts

Although the inclusion of hail amounts with snowfall amounts was discontinued
after December 31, 1955, some stations may have hail amounts included with
snowfall after this date, as late as 1963 at a few stations.  This occurred
because on the original manuscript form the same column was used for the entry
of snow, sleet and hail and the entry was not indicated as hail.  For NWS sites,
hail was again included in snowfall amounts beginning in 1989.

16.  Quality Statement:

This data set has been used in countless climatological studies, litigations,
insurance claims, and various other research applications.

It must be understood that at the onset of punched card processing of
climatological observations, the primary goal was the publication of the monthly
climatological summaries.  The conversion from manual to automated systems meant
that more work could be done faster with fewer people and at less cost.  Even
though the punched cards were retained, it was never envisioned that 20 to 30
years from then a great number of users would be seeking large data files for
retrospective studies using high-speed computers.

Benign neglect, state-of-the-art processing (CIRCA 1952), and limited resources
(monetary and personnel) all contributed toward less than optimum conditions for
maintaining the integrity of the digital files.  Many of these shortcomings are
now recognized and efforts are underway to upgrade the principal data sets.

22.  Summary:

This Summary of the Day First Order data file contains daily selected elements
of observations taken by certified observers.  The stations are located
worldwide and are operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), U.S. Air Force
(AWS), U.S. Navy (Navy Weather Service), and the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA).  TD-3210 station history locations are known to the nearest minute of
latitude and longitude.  The observations are generally recorded for the 24-HR
period midnight to midnight.

Through the years approximately 1,380 principle stations have recorded
observations in the program.  In 1985 there were just
under 428 active stations being processed for inclusion in the digital TD-3210
data file.  Keep in mind when using this data set that stations have varying
periods of record and varying types of data elements.

In September 1992, the NWS began implementation of the Automated Surface
Observing System (ASOS) with four sites.  Implementation is expected to be
completed in 1996 and include approximately 2000 NWS, FAA and Military
locations.  The data will be transmitted via AFOS until the AWIPS-90
communication system is operational.

In the early years of aviation most stations were located in major cities.  As
aviation became more sophisticated, stations shifted to airports. Areal coverage
includes the contiguous United States, Caribbean Islands, Pacific Islands, and
other overseas stations of the NWS, FAA, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force.

Elevation for fixed surface locations for the data set are mostly below 1,000
meters above sea level.  The minimum elevation is 1 meter and the maximum is
2,300 meters.

These First Order Stations are usually fully instrumented and therefore record a
complete range of meteorological parameters.  The observations are generally
recorded for the 24-HR period midnight to midnight.

The digital files were transferred from punched cards to magnetic tape (TD-9750)
during the late 1960's.  This card image CARD-345 (TD-9750) remained in effect
until the current element file structure was developed in 1983.  At that time
the historical files were converted to TD-3210 and processing of current data
was completely revised.  The new processing system began with the January 1984
data.

A very small portion of this data dates back to 1890.  Data from the late 1940's
and onward comprise the bulk of this data set.
