7/15/2008:  A compile problem with R2 source code was discovered.  The April-June 2008 analyses and associated
data have been redone.
<p>
The SSI code was recompiled April 3, 2008 to increase the size of the observation arrays.  The source code
changes were checked by two other people.  However, it is believed that the code was compiled using an old
BUFR library.  The fields had the right large scale structure (warm tropics, cold poles) but had larger than
expected deviations from CDAS.  The code was recompiled May 28, 2008 with the new BUFR library.  After May
28th, the deviations from CDAS returned to normal.  
<p>
Please replace all R2 analyses downloaded from NOMADS before July 15, 2008 with the updated versions.
