Data set updated:       August 4, 2005
Release notes updated:  November 23, 2005

A general description of the data set is here:

Release notes:

1.  Data set version name, and date of creation:  SA18, 2005-aug-4

2.  Differences between this version and previous version SA17:

2a.  Source data from Brazil was extensively updated.  Most of the updates were new data for 2004 and early 2005.
  There were a few added stations.  There were a few corrections to historical data.

2b.  Averaging of station data at identical coordinates is now incorporated.  The areas that are most 
significantly affected are Argentina, northeastern Brazil, and the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo.  Also affected 
to a lesser degree are the Brazilian state of Amazonas, and occasional other other areas throughout the rest of 
the extent.

2c.  The array of daily observation counts is now included in each data file by default.  Counts are the number 
of included observations AFTER averaging data at identical coordinates (2b).

3.  This data set will be revised as source data are added, historical records are revised, and quality control 
methods are improved.

4.  For information about NetCDF file format, access libraries, visualization software, utilities, and 
translators, please visit Unidata's NetCDF website:

  http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf/index.html

For translation to ASCII, we recommend the program "ncdump", which is a standard component of NetCDF software 
distrubutions.

5.  The data rich areas on the grids benefit from spatial smoothing of many nearby stations.  However, many grid 
point values are based on a single station or a very small number of stations.

This results in frequent "data noise" in sparsely populated grid points.  This behavior includes zeros and 
abnormal high spikes due to individual storm events.  This is especially common at the outer edges of the 
populated data regions.  Users should take these conditions into account.

6.  We request that the following article be cited if these data sets are used in publication:

  South America.  Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 86, 1567-1570.
