    <h1>NCEP/NCAR CDAS/Reanalysis</h1>

The analysis is available here as a <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/">dataset</a>, including an interactive viewer and downloadable data files.
<p>
      Entries are included for much more of the dataset than is
      currently on-line. We are starting with the MONTHLY data and
    working our way to finer resolution as needed. Check the <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/outline.html">outline</a> to see which variables are actually on-line here at present (see below for other sources).

<p> The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project is a joint project between the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, formerly
"NMC") and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The
goal of this joint effort is to produce new atmospheric analyses 
using historical data (1957 onwards) and as well to produce analyses of 
the current atmospheric state (Climate Data Assimilation System, CDAS).  
</p>

<p> Until recently, the meteorological community has had to use analyses
that supported the real-time weather forecasting.  These analyses are
very inhomogeneous in time as there have been big improvements in the
data assimilation systems.  This played havoc with climate monitoring
as these improvements were often produced changes in the apparent
"climate".  Even fundamental quantities such as the strength of
the Hadley cell has changed over the years as a result of the
changes in the data assimilation systems. </p>

<p> The quality and utility of the re-analyses should be superior to
NCEP's original analyses because </p>

<dl><dl><dt>
<li> a state-of-the-art data assimilation is used <br>
<li> more observations are used <br>
<li> quality control has been improved <br>
<li> the model/data assimilation procedure will remain essentially
unchanged during the project <br>
<li> many more fields are being saved (ex. potential vorticity
on isentropic surfaces, diabatic heating) <br>
<li> global (some older analyses were hemispheric) <br>
<li> better vertical resolution (stratosphere) <br>
