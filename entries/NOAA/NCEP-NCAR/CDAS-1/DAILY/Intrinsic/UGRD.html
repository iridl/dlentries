The <a href=>UGRD Data</a> data was recopied from
<a
href="http://sgi62.wwb.noaa.gov:8080/reanlm//test.daily.flux/">http://sgi62.wwb.noaa.gov:8080/reanlm//test.daily.flux/</a>.  Now our holdings
represent the complete daily GRIB files for pressure level UGRD data.
<p>
Also see the <a href="http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.dataset_documentation.html">Reanalysis documentation</a>.
<p>
The original reanalysis is supplied by year and updated periodically.
This table shows when the datafiles were last updated.  Think of these as 
version labels, i.e. if the time has changed since you last looked at the data,
the data may have changed.  This is because new dates reflect NOAA file times
-- the actual copying may occur a few days to a few weeks later.
<P>
The current year is updated daily and trails a few days behind the calendar date.
