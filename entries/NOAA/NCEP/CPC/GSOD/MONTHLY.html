This collection of global weather station data from 1979 to the present
is available as a <a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.GSOD/.MONTHLY/">dataset</a>, including an
    interactive data viewer and downloadable data files.

The <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/">NOAA Climate

We also serve some  of the  <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/.GLOBALSOD/">daily weather station data</a> used in this summary.
