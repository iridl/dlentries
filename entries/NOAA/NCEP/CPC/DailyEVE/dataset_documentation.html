<h3>Daily EVE (GTS) station precipitation and temperature data from the CPC</h3>
<p>
<i>The following information is excerpted from the "GTS_STATION.README" file associated with this data set:</i>

<pre>


1.  file names 

    gts_dly_precip_station.lnx.yyyy.raw  
         binary data file of daily GTS station precip for year yyyy;

    gts_dly_maxtem_station.lnx.yyyy.raw  
         binary data file of daily GTS maximum temperature for year yyyy;  

    gts_dly_mintem_station.lnx.yyyy.raw  
         binary data file of daily GTS minimum temperature for year yyyy;  

2.  file contents and struture  

    2.1  contents

    Included in this package are daily precipitation, maximum / minimum 
    temperatures observed at the GTS stations and archived at NOAA/CPC;  

    The CPC archives start from later 1977 and are stored in yearly files 
    for each of the three variables separately;

    All together, there are 15,186 GTS stations with daily reports for 
    at least a sub-portion of the archive period. The WMO IDs, latitude,
    longitude, station name and other related information for these stations 
    are given at an ASCII file:

           GTS_STATION_LIST.TXT 

    2.2  format 

    The yearly files for the three variables are stored in the same format;  

    Each yearly file for a physical variable (precip, Max/Min T) is composed 
    of 365 (366) records, one for each date and stored in the order of Julian 
    day (e.g. data for Feb.1 is in record #32); 

    Each record consists of 15,186 4-byte integers representing daily observations 
    for each of the 15,186 stations arranged in the same order as in the station 
    list file (e.g.  the 101st integer in the record #32 is the daily reports 
    of Feb.1 for the 101st station list in 'GTS_STATION_LIST.TXT'); 

    The unit is 0.1 mm (5 means 0.5 mm) for precip and 0.1C for temperatures; 

    The integers are written in little_endian byte order, meanning that you need 
    to swap the byte order if you are working with a work station such as SGI. 
    Nothing needs to be done if you are working with a Linux machine;

    The filess are written as 'direct' access with no marks in-between the records. 

    The volume of a yearly file for a non-leap year is 
        365 (days) x 15,186 (stations) x (4 bytes) = 22,171,560 bytes
