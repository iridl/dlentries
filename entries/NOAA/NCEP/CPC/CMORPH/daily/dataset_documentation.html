                    CMORPH 0.25 degree DAILY Information

                      Last Update: November 8 2004

The 0.25 degree daily CMORPH can be found on the ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov
server in the /pub/precip/global_CMORPH/daily_025deg/ directory
 

The data are compressed using the standard Unix compress function (files have a
suffix of ".Z"). Each file is composed of 2 direct access binary ("big_endian")
records that are defined as follows:

Record 1: contains the merged microwave precipitation only (GrADS variable: comb)
Record 2: contains the "CMORPH" precipitation estimates (GrADS variable: cmorph)

All units are "mm/hr".  Missing data are denoted by values of "-9999."
Each record contains a 1440 x 480 REAL*4 array of data which
is oriented from 0.125E EASTward and from 59.875N SOUTHward, with a grid increment
of 0.25 degrees of latitude and longitude.  Thus, the grid locations are the
centers of a 0.25 degree lat/lon grid box.  Note that these estimates represent
spatial averages, so the data aare grid-centered, rather than lattice-centered.

For example (1,1) is 0.125E, 59.875N
            (2,2) is 0.375E, 59.625N
	    
	    
	    , etc.
	    
	    
The daily accumulation period is 00Z thru 23:59Z.

For GrADS users, a descriptor ("ctl") file CMORPH+MWCOMB_025deg-daily.ctl
has been provided.


Sample FORTRAN code for reading the data sets is provided below

      program readday

      parameter (IRMAX=1440, JRMAX=480, PMAX=2)

      character*115 in1ssmipropREGD
      real*4 ssmipropREGD(IRMAX,JRMAX,PMAX)

      write (*,*) ' enter day ie 20041107 '
      read (*,*) iyrmndy

c    Open input daily 0.25 deg lat/lon CMORPH rainfall file

      in1ssmipropREGD = '/export-2/sgi109/irstat/blended_tech/cpc/data/0
     &25deg/YYYY0M0D_dly-025deg_cpc+comb'
      write (in1ssmipropREGD(54:61),'(i8)') iyrmndy
      write(6,'('' file '',a88)') in1ssmipropREGD

      open (unit=16, file=in1ssmipropREGD, access='direct',
     &              recl=1440*480*2*4, form='unformatted')

c    Read daily me derived regional precip to disk

      read (16, rec = 1) ssmipropREGD

      write (6,'(/,'' daily CMORPH '')')
      do jreg = 121, 140
       write(6,'(15(f5.1))') (ssmipropREGD(ireg,jreg,2),ireg=581,595)
      enddo

      stop
