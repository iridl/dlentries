<h3>Description of the OI.v2 Monthly SST Analysis (v2 indicates version 2)</h3>
<p>

The NOAA OI.v2 SST monthly fields are derived by a linear interpolation of
the weekly optimum interpolation (OI) version 2 fields to daily fields then
averaging the daily values over a month. The monthly fields are in the
same format and spatial resolution as the weekly fields.
<p>
The OI.v2 analysis is described in Reynolds, R.W., N.A. Rayner, T.M. 
Smith, D.C. Stokes, and W. Wang, 2002: An Improved In Situ and Satellite 
SST Analysis for Climate. <i>J. Climate</i>, <b>15</b>, 1609-1625.  
<br><p>
The ice field shows the approximate monthly average of the ice 
concentration values input to the SST analysis.  Ice concentration is 
stored as the percentage of are of area covered.  For the ice fields, the 
value 122 represents land or coast.  Note, the ice land mask is a function 
of the ice analysis and may change periodically.
<p>
The sst and ice fields are on a 1-degree (360 lon by 180 lat) grid.
The first gridbox of each array is centered on 0.5E, 89.5S.  The points
move eastward to 359.5E, then northward to 89.5N.
<p>
The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas and the Great Lakes.  
There is no analysis over land.  The land values are filled by a Cressman
interpolation to produce a complete grid for possible interpolation to 
other grids.  The ocean and land areas are defined by a land sea mask.  
This data set is a binary, direct access file, lstags.ondeg.dat, which 
is included in the same directory.  The spatial grid is defined identically 
to the grid for the SST arrays.  
<p>
Please note, a new climatology based on these fields was derived by Yan 
Xue of NCEPs Climate Prediction Center following the technique of 
Reynolds and Smith (1995) and Smith and Reynolds (1998).  The new 
climatology is available in:
