                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1 Objective/Purpose.

    The goals of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) are (1) to 
    understand the radiation balance between the Sun, Earth, atmosphere, and 
    space and (2) to establish an accurate, long-term  baseline data set for 
    detection of climate changes.  Earth radiation budget (ERB) data are 
    fundamental to the development of realistic climate models and to the 
    understanding of natural and anthropogenic perturbations of the climate 
    system.  As part of ERBE, measurements of broadband shortwave radiation 
    reflected from the Earth-atmosphere system were obtained, from which 
    albedo values were calculated.  In addition, values from scenes determined 
    to be free of clouds were analyzed separately and clear-sky albedos were 
    derived.

3.2 Summary of Parameters.

    For this study, only the clear-sky albedos are included.

3.3 Discussion.

    Clear-sky albedos were obtained from the scanning radiometer instruments 
    on Earth Radiation Budget Experiment.  For details on the ERBE satellites, 
    instruments, and data analysis techniques, the user is referred to 
    Barkstrom et al. (1990), Harrison et al. (1990), and Harrison et al. 
    (1993).

                     4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is the first Earth radiation 
budget instrument flown simultaneously on multiple satellites to provide the 
necessary temporal sampling for studying the diurnal variations of regional 
broadband radiative parameters over the Earth.  Identical ERBE instruments 
were launched on a dedicated NASA satellite (the Earth Radiation Budget 
Satellite, ERBS) by the Space Shuttle Challenger in October 1984, and two NOAA 
operational satellites launched in December 1984 and November 1986.  The high-
resolution ERBE scanning radiometers were used to determine regional scale 
radiative parameters.  The ERBS obtained 5 years of scanner data; each of the 
NOAA satellites provided about 2 years of scanner data.  

The ERBE data processing system performs three major tasks: 

     (1) Converts telemetry data to calibrated radiation measurements at the 
         instruments.

     (2) Relates the satellite measurements to radiative flux at the top of 
         the Earth's atmosphere using angular dependence models (Smith et al., 
         1986).

     (3) Averages the measurements over various space and time scales (Brooks 
         et al., 1986).  

The ERBE scanners observe pixels with a nadir size of 35-50 km depending on 
the satellite.  Each 2.5 x 2.5 degree grid box of the original ERBE data 
contained approximately 100 pixels.  These pixels are classified as four 
types:  clear, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, and overcast.  A maximum 
likelihood estimation technique is used to identify cloud-free scenes 
(Wielicki and Green, 1989).  Clear-sky radiative fluxes at each hour in a grid 
box are calculated as the averaged fluxes of the clear pixels, which are 
converted from radiance measurements through the ERBE angular-directional 
models (Suttles et al., 1988).

                             5.0  EQUIPMENT

5.1 Instrument Description.

    The ERBE scanner (Kopia, 1986) has three spectral channels, 0.2-5.0  m 
    (SW), 5-50  m (LW), and 0.2-50  m (total), to provide consistency checks 
    and redundancy.  The scanner spatial resolution at nadir, the point on the 
    Earth directly below the spacecraft, is about 40 km.  The ERBE scanner is 
    accurate, well calibrated, and stable.  

    5.1.1  Platform.

           ERBE scanning radiometers were flown on three satellites:  ERBS in 
           a 57-deg inclined orbit and NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 in sun synchronous 
           orbits at 14:30 and 07:30 equatorial crossing times, respectively.

    5.1.2  Mission Objectives.

           The goal of ERBE is to understand the radiation balance between the 
           sun, earth, atmosphere, and space, and to establish an accurate 
           baseline data set for detection of climate changes.

    5.1.4  Principles of Operation.

           Not applicable.

    5.1.5  Instrument Measurement Geometry.

           The ERBE scanner operates in a cross track mode, covering viewing 
           zenith angles from nadir to the limb.  In the processing, only 
           viewing zenith angles less than 70 degrees are considered.  

    5.1.6  Manufacturer of Instrument.

           TRW, Redondo Beach, CA.

5.2  Calibration.

     Ground calibration sources consist of a reference blackbody and an 
     integrating sphere in a vacuum chamber.  In flight, an internal 
     blackbody, evacuated tungsten lamps, and observations of the Sun are used 
     to check the stability and precision of the instruments.

                            6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     The ERBE scanner data are available from the Langley Distributed Active 
     Archive Center (DAAC) as well as the National Space Science Data Center 
     in Greenbelt, MD.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     ERBS scanner data coverage is from 70S to 70N latitude.  The NOAA 
     satellites have complete global coverage. The original ERBE albedo data 
     had a spatial resolution of 2.5 x 2.5 degree latitude/longitude grid;  
     individual measurements have a resolution of about 40 km at nadir.  For 
     this CD-ROM, the Goddard DAAC has mapped the data onto a 1 degree equal 
     angle lat/lon grid (see section 9.3.1  for details).

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in file are ordered from North to 
            South and from West to East beginning at 180 degrees West and 90 
            degrees North.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered at 
            89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 x 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            January 1987 through December 1988.

     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution.

9.1  Formulas.

     For details of the ERBE data processing algorithm, the user is referred 
     to Barkstrom and Smith (1986), Smith et al. (1986), Brooks et al. (1986), 
     Suttles et al. (1988, 1989), and the ERBE S4 User's Guide which is on-
     line at the Langley DAAC. (userserv@eosdis.larc.nasa.gov)

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.

            Clear-sky albedo is calculated from ERBE measurements.  For a 
            clear-sky shortwave measurement, the clear-sky albedo is defined 
            as the ratio of the outgoing shortwave to the incoming solar flux.  
            For that day, clear-sky albedos at other hours are filled in using 
            the ERBE directional models.  Using only the days with clear-sky 
            measurements, the monthly average clear-sky albedo is determined.  
            The data are mapped onto a 1 x 1 degree grid for this data set.

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     Top-of-atmosphere monthly mean albedo is derived from shortwave (0.2-5  
     m) radiances measured by the ERBE scanners (Kopia, 1986) on the ERBS and 
     NOAA-9 spacecraft.  

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            This is the first version of this data set.

9.3  Calculations.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            Below is a description of the re-gridding process done by the 
            Goddard DAAC:

            Physical Lay Out of Original Data:   These data were subset from 
            the GEDEX CD.  Resulting Input data consisted of two files, with 
            each file containing one year worth of data.  Within each file 
            the data were arranged with one data value and corresponding time, 
            latitude, and longitude per line.

            Logical Lay Out of Original Data:   These data were on a 2.5 x 2.5 
            degree grid, with the data starting at 0 longitude, 90 latitude 
            and progressing eastward, and then southward to 360 longitude, -90 
            latitude.  The data at the poles consisted of only one grid value.  
            All other latitude bands consisted of a grid value every 2.5 
            degrees.

               Processing Steps done by the Goddard DAAC:  Regrid each 
               latitude and longitude band of data by implementing the 
               following steps:

               1) Replicated every data value in each latitude band 360 times, 
                  assigning them to a temporary array.  Each of the original 
                  latitude bands had 144 data values, which replicated 360 
                  times produces a temporary array of 51840 data values for 
                  that latitude band.
               2) The first 144 (temporary array) data values are summed and 
                  then divided by the number (144) of original latitude band 
                  values. This was repeated 359 more times, for every 144 
                  (temporary array) data values, in affect performing a linear 
                  interpolation of the data within the latitude band.
               3) Step 1 and 2 were repeated until all latitude bands have 
                  been interpolated.
               4) A test for fill value occurrence was performed.  If fill 
                  value constitutes 50 % or more of contributing values then 
                  assign a fill value to that grid cell, otherwise compute the 
                  average data value for grid cell from only those points 
                  constituting data values.  When assigning fill values, a new 
                  fill value was used, as the existing one was extremely 
                  large.
               5) The same method, discussed above, was used for regridding 
                  each longitude band of data, except that the number of 
                  replications was 180.  Utilizing the same test for fill 
                  value mentioned above, and the same fill substitution.
               6) The resulting array of data values were then split and 
                  shifted from 0 longitude -> 360 longitude to -180 longitude 
                  -> 180 longitude.
               7) These data were then flipped from -180 longitude, -90 
                  latitude to -180 longitude, 90 latitude.

                              10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      Errors in clear-sky albedo come from cloud contamination of the scene,  
      instrument errors, sampling errors, and uncertainties in models used in 
      processing.

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              The ERBE clear-sky albedo values are validated by comparison 
              with data from other satellite and aircraft observations of 
              clear scenes.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              The user is referred to Harrison et al. (1990) for a discussion 
              of ERBE error sources.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              Random error is about 0.01.  Values may also be overestimated 
              slightly due to cloud contamination.  (See Harrison et al., 
              1990).

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

              Not available at this revision.

                                11.  NOTES

11.1  Known Problems with the data.

      There are no known data gaps or other problems.

11.2  Usage Guidance.

      Errors in the polar regions may be larger than those quoted in Sec. 10 
      due to the inability to reliably distinguish between clouds and snow.

11.3  Other Relevant Information.

      The clear sky albedos, estimated from ERBE, generally are a little 
      higher than albedos calculated for a molecular atmosphere with best 
      estimates of surface albedos (over the oceans surface albedos are low 
      and fairly well known).  Some of this difference is likely due to 
      aerosols effect not included in the calculation and some due to the fact 
      that ERBE may designate scenes as clear when they have a small amount of 
      subpixel cloudiness in their view.
