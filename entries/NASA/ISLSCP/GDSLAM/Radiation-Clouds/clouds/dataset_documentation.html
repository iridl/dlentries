                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The purpose of the ISCCP C2 monthly mean cloud data is to provide a 
     global climatology of cloud properties to be used in the study of global 
     radiation balance and hydrological cycle.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Monthly mean; for cloud amount, cloud top pressure, cloud optical 
                   thickness and cloud water path.

3.3  Discussion.

     The ISCCP Stage C2 data represent a monthly summary of the ISCCP C1 data 
     (Rossow and Schiffer, 1991).  Monthly averages are first made at constant 
     diurnal phase for each of the 3-hour periods; eight sets of averages for 
     each month describe the mean diurnal variations of cloud and surface 
     properties.  The complete monthly mean is then constructed by averaging 
     these eight sets.  The cloud data on this CD-ROM consists only of the 
     complete monthly mean data.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS.

The primary data sets used to infer the cloud properties are the Stage B3, 
reduced resolution narrowband radiance (600 nm and 11,000 nm) measurements 
made by the imaging radiometers on operational weather satellites (Schiffer 
and Rossow, 1985; Rossow et al., 1987).  These data have a nominal spatial 
resolution of 30 km and temporal resolution of 3 hours produced by up to five 
geostationary satellites (METEOSAT, INSAT, GMS, GOES-EAST and GOES-WEST) and 
up to two polar orbiting NOAA satellite.  Only one year of complete INSAT data 
have been obtained but they are not included here.  The absolute radiometric 
calibration of all B3 radiances have been normalized to that of the AVHRR on 
NOAA-7 in July 1983.  Subsequent comparisons to aircraft data led to a 
revision of the VIS radiance calibration, accomplished by multiplying all 
values by a factor of 1.2.  This corrected calibration is used to produce the 
cloud products. No change was made in the IR absolute calibration.

The Stage C Cloud Data Products are produced by analysis of the visible (VIS = 
600.0 nm) and thermal infrared (IR = 11,000 nm) radiances from all of the 
satellites, merged into a single global product, and reduced in volume by 
summarizing cloud variations at a 280 km resolution (equivalent to 2.5 degrees 
lat/long at the equator).  Stage C1 data report global results every 3 hours 
(Rossow et al., 1991).  Stage C2 data are monthly summaries of the Stage C1 
data with the same spatial resolution and including mean diurnal variations.  
The ISCCP C2 cloud data on this CD-ROM contains only the complete monthly mean 
data for the parameters; cloud amount, cloud top pressure, cloud optical 
thickness and column total of water. Note that the latter two parameters are 
measured only during daytime, when visible radiances are available. This 
version of water path was calculated after computing the spatial average cloud 
optical thickness, from which it is derived; hence, the values reported are 
expected to systematically underestimate actual water path values.

                              5.  EQUIPMENT.

The primary ISCCP data set is radiance data obtained from a global set of 
operational weather satellite imaging radiometers, which have in common a 
narrowband spectral channel at about 600 nm near the peak of the solar 
spectrum and one in the atmosphere's thermal opacity "window" near 11,000 nm.  
Some of these radiometers have additional channels.  The spatial resolution of 
the raw images ranges between 1 - 4 km (visible channel) and between 4 - 7 km 
(infrared channel).  Imaging frequency (for a specific low latitude location) 
varies from 48 to 14 times per day for geostationary satellites to twice daily 
for polar orbiting satellites.

     5.1.2  Mission Objectives.

            These are operational weather satellites.

     5.1.3  Key Variables.

            Radiances measured approximately at visible (600 nm) and near 
            infrared (11,000 nm) wavelengths were used from these instruments 
            to produce the ISCCP B3 data.

     5.1.4  Principles of Operation.

            NOAA/AVHRR:

            The AVHRR is a four or five channel scanning radiometer that 
            operates in the visible, near-infrared, and far-infrared regions.  
            The fifth channel was added on the AVHRR/2 instrument flown on 
            NOAA-7, -9, -11 and -12. Scanning is provided by an elliptical 
            beryllium mirror rotating at 360 rpm about an axis parallel to the 
            Earth.  A two-stage radiant cooler is designed to provide a basic 
            temperature of 95 degrees K for the IR detectors.  The telescope 
            is an 8-inch afocal, all-reflective system, with polarization of 
            less than 10 percent.  Instrument operation is controlled by 26 
            commands and monitored by 20 analog housekeeping parameters. 

            GOES/VISSR:

            The VISSR instrument operates in the visible region of 0.55 to 
            0.75 micrometers and in the infrared region of 10.5 to 12.6 
            micrometers.  Each of the eight photo-multiplier tubes on the 
            visible detector is 0.025 X 0.021 mrads, with a dynamic range of 
            3-100% albedo.  The infrared portion of the instrument consists of 
            two detectors cooled to 95 degrees K, with an instantaneous field-
            of-view (IFOV) of 192 X 192 microradians.  The VISSR telescope has 
            an aperture of 40 cm and a focal length of 291 cm, and routes the 
            IR wavelengths to separate detectors.  The video analog output of 
            all detectors is transmitted to the VISSR Digital Multiplexer 
            (VDM) where it is sequentially sampled every 2 microseconds by the 
            visible channel and every 8 microseconds by the IR channel.  

            METEOSAT/MIR:

            The Multispectral Imaging Radiometer (MIR) sensor on METEOSAT is a 
            scanning radiometer which provides images in the visible and 
            thermal IR regions of the spectrum.  The instrument produces 
            images of the full Earth disc viewed from a geostationary orbit.  
            A reduced image format, corresponding to a limited band across the 
            Earth's disc, may be selected by telecommand.  The optical 
            reflector system of the radiometer includes a movable Ritchey-
            Chretien telescope with primary and secondary mirrors.  This 
            includes a mirror located in the center of the primary mirror 
            inclined at 45 degrees to the optical axis, four folding mirrors, 
            and a separation mirror for diverting light to the visible sensor. 

            The optically-collected visible and IR signals are converted into 
            analog electric signals by five detectors.  These are divided into 
            two subsets, two visible and three IR.  The detectors are 
            distributed across the focal plane of the radiometer and as a 
            result of the relative displacement of the detectors in this 
            plane, their respective fields-of-view (FOV) do not coincide but 
            are displaced relative to each other. 

            The two visible detectors are positioned in the focal plane of the 
            primary telescope.  Their instantaneous FOV at the Earth's surface 
            (2.5 square km) is determined by their physical size (250 X 250 
            micrometers sensitive area) and the telescope's focal length (3650 
            millimeters).  While the visible detectors function properly at 
            ambient temperatures, the three IR detectors must be cooled to 
            less than 95 degrees K. 

            Each IR detector is 70 square micrometers and generates an 
            instantaneous 5 km square FOV at the subsatellite point.  One 
            visible channel time shares with the water vapor channel so that 
            the resolution of the visible image changes depending on the 
            choice of channels. 

            GMS/VISSR:

            The GMS Visible and IR Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) is very 
            similar to the scanning radiometers carried on Synchronous 
            Meteorological Satellite (SMS) and GOES (1 through 3) satellites 
            except for some modifications to stepping gears and detector 
            portions.  The number of steps in each scan is 2500 for the IR 
            detector on GMS versus 1821 for GOES.  

            INSAT/VISSR:

            The INSAT VISSR is also a scanning radiometer with a visible 
            channel covering 0.55 to 0.75 micrometers and an IR channel 
            covering the 10.5 to 12.5 micrometer spectral regions.  The full 
            disc can be scanned every half-hour (23 minute scan plus 7 minute 
            housekeeping), processing from north to south.  Sector scanning of 
            the 1/4 disc (full east to west, 1/4 north to south) is possible 
            every 6 minutes.

5.2  Calibration.

     Calibration procedures for the instruments can be found in Rossow et 
     al., (1987), Brest and Rossow (1992), and Desormeaux et al., (1993).

     5.2.1  Specifications.

            See section 5.2.

            5.2.1.1  Tolerance.

                     See section 5.2.

     5.2.2  Frequency of Calibration.

            See section 5.2.

     5.2.3  Other Calibration Information.

            Although procedures are applied to normalize the radiances 
            measured by various satellites to the reference polar orbiter 
            (afternoon) measurements (Rossow et al. 1987), the precision of 
            the normalization procedures leaves small residual differences 
            which can be amplified by the process to retrieve physical 
            quantities.  The collection of monthly comparison statistics 
            provides more statistical weight with which to estimate these 
            residuals.

            To produce Stage C1 data, results from several satellites are 
            merged into a single global dataset.  In regions where more than 
            one satellite provides results, the merger process selects the 
            preferred satellite according to a specified hierarchy that favors 
            data continuity and observations made closer to nadir view.  
            Frequency histograms of the differences in the overlapping 
            measurements between all pairs of satellites are collected and the 
            modal value estimated from the average of the mode value and the 
            three nearest values above and below the mode value.  These 
            estimated differences for each satellite when compared to the 
            reference polar orbiter are applied to adjust for small residual 
            radiance calibration differences.  The quantities in the hour-
            monthly mean that are corrected are: cloud optical thickness and 
            water path.  Magnitudes of these corrections are illustrated in 
            the table bellow.

            Magnitude of calibration adjustments applied to Stage C2 data to 
            remove small residual calibration differences shown as the 
            standard deviation and range of all corrections applied to each 
            satellite over the period July 1983 - February 1987.

            PARAMETER                    STD DEV               RANGE
            --------------------------------------------------------------
            Cloud Optical Thickness      0.02                  + or - 0.08
            Cloud Water Path             0.02                  + or - 0.08

            Special METEOSAT adjustment

            The spectral response of the METEOSAT "visible" channel is wider 
            than that of the other radiometers used in the ISCCP analysis; 
            normalization of METEOSAT radiances is done using spectrally 
            uniform targets (clouds and clear ocean areas). The spectral 
            response difference means that surface reflectance determined for 
            vegetated land areas are larger for METEOSAT than for the other 
            satellites. This difference in surface reflectance is removed in 
            the hour-monthly mean dataset by using regression relations that 
            are obtained by comparing METEOSAT and NOAA measurements as a 
            function of vegetation type and season. A single relationship that 
            varies with season was found to represent differences as a 
            function of vegetation type. Adjustment factors are applied for 
            each season and are given in the table below. Unadjusted values 
            can be recovered from Stage C2 values by multiplying by the slopes 
            given in the table below and adding the intercept values. 

            Adjustment factors applied to METEOSAT land surface reflectances 
            to reduce them to values measured at an approximate wavelength of 
            600 + or - 100 nm. Seasons are the standard three-month periods 
            for the northern hemisphere.

            Adjustment: Adjusted = (original value - intercept)/slope

9.1  Formulas.

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.

            The cloud analysis algorithm for ISCCP-C1 was developed from a
            three year pilot study that compared the performance of nine
            different algorithms applied to the same data (Rossow et al.,
            1985; Rossow, W.B. and R.A. Schiffer, 1991).  This algorithm has
            three fundamental parts:  cloud detection, radiative transfer
            model analysis, and statistical analysis.

            A. Cloud Detection.

            The cloud detection step analyzes the radiance data twice:  first
            to determine an estimate for the radiance values that represent
            clear conditions and second, to determine which radiance
            measurements deviate from these clear sky values (Rossow and
            Garder, 1993a).  Cloudy conditions are defined to be those that
            exhibit radiance values that are sufficiently different from the
            clear values.

            To avoid spurious diurnal variations of cloudiness caused by
            changes in methodology associated with the presence or absence of
            VIS data, the clear sky composite procedure relies primarily on IR
            radiance tests to obtain both the VIS and IR clear radiances.
            However, since the daytime results can be improved by use of the
            VIS channel measurements, these results are incorporated so that
            the IR-only results can be reconstructed.

            The algorithm used to produce this C1 data does not use any
            correlative data to construct the clear sky composite, except four
            classification data sets that indicate whether a particular
            location is land, water, or coast, gives the type of vegetation
            cover for land areas, indicates the presence of snow or sea ice
            cover, and whether the topography is high or rough.

            B.  Radiative Transfer Model Analysis 

            Once pixels are classified as cloudy or clear, the radiances are 
            compared to radiative transfer model calculations designed to 
            simulate the measurements of the AVHRR channels (to which all the 
            radiometers have been normalized).  These comparisons are used to 
            isolate the surface reflectances and temperatures from the clear 
            radiances and the cloud optical thicknesses and cloud top 
            temperatures from the cloudy radiances (Rossow et al. 1991).  
            Atmospheric properties that affect the satellite measured 
            radiances are specified from the correlative data. 

            C. Statistical Analysis

            Averages and variances of all cloud, surface and radiance
            quantities are reported in C1 data for 280 km regions; however,
            only average quantities are included in the CD dataset.  Cloud
            parameters represent averages over all cloudy pixels in each
            region at that time.

            A single C1 data file represents the merging of analysis results
            from all available satellites within the three hour time period.
            The basic objective of the ISCCP-C2 analysis is to summarize the
            cloud analysis results (Stage C1 data) on a monthly time scale.
            To preserve information about diurnal variability, the results are
            first averaged over the calendar month, separately for 00, 03, 06,
            09, 12, 15, 18, and 21 GMT. Then, these eight results
            are averaged to obtain the monthly mean values, but first
            a number of adjustments are made.

            Averaging the quantities from Stage C1 data to produce the Stage 
            C2 data can be done in two ways, depending on the purpose.  Some 
            quantities, such as cloud optical thickness or cloud top 
            temperature, are related to the effect of clouds on radiation in a 
            non-linear way.  Thus, an average value meant to be indicative of 
            the average radiative effect of clouds must give equal weight to 
            these values proportional to their radiative effect.  Since these 
            quantities were retrieved from radiation measurements, this 
            weighting is also related to the variation of relative measurement 
            precision over the range of the parameters.  All quantities in 
            Stage C2 data are averaged in this way, except for parameter 20, 
            called PATH.  For most parameters, this weighting procedure 
            produces an average value that is not much different than that 
            given by a simple linear average.  This is not the case for cloud 
            optical thickness, where a simple linear average produces a global 
            monthly mean value that is about 60% larger than that produced by 
            an energy-weighted average.  The optical thicknesses give the 
            value that represents the average radiative effect of the clouds, 
            whereas water path is proportional to the cloud water content 
            times the vertical extent of the cloud.  Optical thicknesses are 
            averaged in a non-linear manner, while water path represents the 
            linear average of optical thickness.  For a constant cloud 
            particle size distribution (as assumed in the retrieval of optical 
            thicknesses), cloud water path, WP, is given by 

                                 WP = [40/3]*[r~ * PATH]/Q    kg/m**2

            where r~ is the average particle radius in cm, and Q is the 
            normalized Mie extinction efficiency at 0.6 micrometers 
            wavelength.  For the cloud particle size distribution used, with 
            r~ approximately equal to -.001 cm, 

                                      WP = 6.292 PATH    g/m**2

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            The ISCCP C1 data are produced from the analysis of a reduced 
            resolution satellite radiance dataset (B3 data), together with 
            four correlative datasets that describe properties of the 
            atmosphere and surface.  The B3 data have a nominal 30 km 
            resolution.  Radiance values at the 30 kilometer resolution for 
            each of the sensors are normalized to the polar orbiter radiometer 
            response.  Stage C1 data represent the global, merged results 
            reported every 3 hours with a spatial resolution of 280 km; Stage 
            C2 data are the monthly averages and the other summary statistics 
            of the Stage C1 quantities.  The ISCCP-C2 data on this CD-ROM is 
            comprised of complete monthly means for the parameters; cloud 
            amount, cloud top pressure, cloud optical thickness and cloud 
            water path. The Goddard DAAC converted this data from it's 
            original grid to a 1 degree equal angle grid (see section 9.3.1).

9.3  Calculations.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            The mean cloud properties reported in the C1 product are the final 
            values from the radiative analysis.  This means that the daytime 
            values of cloud top temperature (TC) and cloud top pressure (PC) 
            have been altered by the effects of the VIS channel measurements.  
            Since the same adjustment is not performed at night, direct 
            comparison of the day and night values of cloud top temperature 
            and pressure must be interpreted with caution.  However, the 
            vertical distribution of clouds can be reconstructed from cloud 
            classes and the mean IR radiance values.  The visible only (VIS-
            ONLY) numbers can be subtracted from the total number of pixels at 
            each pressure level, while the IR radiances can be used to 
            estimate the cloud top temperature and pressure without TAU 
            corrections. 

            Producing the ISCCP-C2 product involved performing a number of 
            adjustments on the ISCCP-C1 data before determining the monthly 
            averages.  The adjustments necessary included VIS adjustments 
            during daytime, VIS adjustments during nighttime, calibration 
            adjustments, standard adjustments, special METEOSAT adjustments, 
            and diurnal adjustments 

            VIS adjustments during daytime (Adj1):

            In the Stage C1 data, two different versions of cloud amount and 
            cloud top temperature/pressure are reported for daytime 
            conditions.  One version of cloud amount is obtained from the IR 
            radiances alone, as must be done for nighttime conditions; the 
            other version combines cloud detections from both the VIS and IR 
            radiances.  IR radiances are insensitive to low-level clouds, 
            especially broken ones, the VIS radiances analysis detects more 
            low-level cloudiness than the IR analysis.  Likewise, one version 
            of the cloud top temperature/pressure is obtained directly from 
            the IR radiances as is done for nighttime conditions and the other 
            version adjusts the values consistent with the cloud optical 
            thickness value retrieved from the VIS radiances. This adjustment 
            is significant only for optically thin clouds, which transmit IR 
            radiation from below the cloud and, consequently, appear to have a 
            higher temperature/pressure than they actually do.  Thus, the 
            VIS/IR version is superior to the IR-only version.  Stage C2 data 
            contain the VIS/IR versions of cloud amount, cloud top temperature 
            and cloud top pressure. 

            VIS adjustments during nighttime (Adj2):

            The mean differences between the VIS/IR and IR-only results during 
            daytime conditions are used to adjust the nighttime results in the 
            hour-monthly mean data.  Daytime differences between VIS/IR and 
            IR-only values of total cloud amount, mean cloud top pressure and 
            cloud top temperature are linearly interpolated over the nighttime 
            periods between the dusk and dawn values.  This interpolated 
            difference is then added to the IR-only value during this time 
            period.  The magnitude of these corrections is generally small.  
            The smaller (<= 5%) cloud amount adjustments are distributed 
            nearly uniformly over the globe with values slightly higher over 
            ocean than over land.  The larger adjustments occur in near 
            coastal regions, land and ocean, in low latitudes primarily 
            associated with tropical rain forests and marine stratus regimes.  
            The unadjusted cloud amount is reported as the last parameter in 
            each map grid cell.  The cloud top pressure correction is positive 
            where low clouds predominate, primarily in marine stratus regimes 
            over oceans, and negative where high, thin clouds predominate, 
            primarily over land, especially in desert areas. 

            Interpolation to fill during nighttime (Adj3)

            Values of the cloud optical thickness (both TAU and PATH) are 
            interpolated over the nighttime period between the dusk and dawn 
            values.  

            Standard adjustment (Adj4):

            To produce Stage C1 data, results from several satellites are 
            merged into a single global dataset.  In regions where more than 
            one satellite provides results, the merger process selects the 
            preferred satellite according to a specified hierarchy that favors 
            data continuity and observations made closer to nadir view.  
            Frequency histograms of the differences in the overlapping 
            measurements between all pairs of satellites are collected and the 
            modal value estimated from the average of the mode value and the 
            three nearest values above and below the mode value.  These 
            estimated differences for each satellite, when compared to the 
            reference polar orbiter, are applied to adjust for small residual 
            radiance calibration differences.  The corrected quantities in the 
            hour-monthly mean are:  cloud top and surface temperature, cloud 
            optical thickness and water path, and surface reflectance.  
            Magnitudes of these corrections are illustrated in the table 
            below.  Actual calibration adjustments for each month are reported 
            in the record prefixes for each parameter for each satellite.

            The magnitude of the calibration adjustments applied to Stage C2 
            data to remove small residual calibration differences are shown 
            here as the standard deviation and range of all corrections 
            applied to each satellite over the period July 1983 - February

            Special METEOSAT adjustment (Adj5):

            The spectral response of the METEOSAT "visible" channel is wider 
            than that of the other radiometers used in the ISCCP analysis; 
            normalization of METEOSAT radiances is done using spectrally 
            uniform targets (clouds and clear ocean areas).  The spectral 
            response difference means that surface reflectances calculated for 
            vegetated land areas from METEOSAT are larger than for the other 
            satellites.  This difference in surface reflectance is removed in 
            the hour-monthly mean dataset by using regression relations that 
            are obtained by comparing METEOSAT and NOAA measurements as a 
            function of vegetation type and season.  A single relationship 
            that varies with season was found to represent differences as a 
            function of vegetation.  Adjustment factors are applied for each 
            season and are given in the table below.  Unadjusted values can be 
            recovered from Stage C2 data by multiplying by the slopes (given 
            in the table below) and adding the intercept values. 

            Adjustment factors applied to METEOSAT land surface reflectances 
            to reduce them to values measured at an approximate wavelength of 
            0.6 + to - 0.1 micrometers are shown in the table below.  Seasons 
            are the standard  three-month periods in the northern hemisphere. 

            Adjustment:  Adjusted Value = (Original Value - Intercept)/Slope

            Diurnal adjustment (Adj6):

            Before the hour-monthly means are combined into a monthly mean, 
            small corrections are made to account for incomplete sampling of 
            the diurnal variations of cloud and surface properties.  An 
            incomplete sample is less than 8 hour-monthly observations at low 
            and middle latitudes.  These adjustments are determined using the 
            zonally averaged variations of the quantities in local time at all 
            locations with eight hour-monthly mean values available.  The 
            diurnal average is calculated for the number of samples actually 
            available and compared with the average of eight samples to 
            determine the effect of sub-sampling on the diurnal average.  The 
            calculations are performed within each latitude interval, 
            separately for land and water areas.  The quantities that are 
            adjusted are the total cloud amount, cloud top temperature and 
            pressure, cloud optical thickness and water path, and the surface 
            temperature.  These adjustments affect only the monthly mean 
            values and are not applied to the individual hour-monthly means. 

            Below is a description of the re-gridding process done by the 
            Goddard DAAC:

               Physical Lay Out of Original Data:   These data were subset 
               from the GEDEX CD.  Resulting input data consisted of one file 
               for both 1987 and 1988.   Within the file the data were 
               arranged with the four chosen parameters for a grid cell and 
               corresponding time, latitude, and longitude per line.

               Logical Lay Out of Original Data:   These data were on a 2.5 x 
               2.5 degree lat/lon grid (72 by 144 grid cells), with the data 
               starting at 0 longitude, -90 latitude and progressing eastward, 
               and then northward to 360 longitude, 90 latitude.  

               Processing steps done by the Goddard DAAC:  Regrid each 
               latitude and longitude band of data by implementing the 
               following steps:

               1) Replicated every data value in each latitude band 360 times, 
                  assigning them to a temporary array.  Each of the original 
                  latitude bands had 144 data values, which replicated 360 
                  times produces a temporary array of 51840 data values for 
                  that latitude band.
               2) The first 144 (temporary array) data values are summed and 
                  then divided by the number (144) of original latitude band 
                  values. This was repeated 359 more times, for every 144 
                  (temporary array) data values, in affect performing a linear 
                  interpolation of the data within the latitude band.
               3) Step 1 and 2 were repeated until all latitude bands have 
                  been interpolated.
               4) A test for fill value occurrance was performed.  If fill 
                  value constitutes 50% or more of contributing values then 
                  assign a fill value to that grid cell, otherwise compute the 
                  average data value for grid cell from only those points 
                  constituting data values.  When assigning fill values, a new 
                  fill value was used, as the existing one was extremely 
                  large.
               5) The same method, discussed above, was used for regridding 
                  each longitude band of data, except that the number of 
                  replications was 180.  Utilizing the same test for fill 
                  value mentioned above, and the same fill substitution.
               6) The resulting array of data values were then split and 
                  shifted from 0 longitude -> 360 longitude to -180 longitude 
                  -> 180 longitude.
               7) These data were then flip from -180 longitude, -90 latitude 
                  to -180 longitude, 90 latitude.

10.1  Sources of Error.

      Some situations where the cloud properties are more uncertain are:
      persistently cloudy locations, winter sea ice, and snow-covered land.

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              Errors in clear-sky radiances (Rossow and Garder, 1993b), 
              suggest uncertainties in the ISCCP cloud detections of about 10% 
              with a small (3%-6%) negative bias over land. Some specific 
              regions exhibit both larger rms uncertainties and somewhat 
              larger biases in cloud amount approaching 10%. ISCCP cloud 
              detections are more in error over the polar regions than 
              anywhere else. Based on comparisons with and analysis of 
              radiances measured at other wavelengths. The ISCCP analysis 
              appears to miss 15%-25% of the clouds in summer but only 5%-10% 
              of the winter clouds. 

              The ISCCP cloud amounts appear (Rossow et al., 1993) too low 
              over land by about 10%. Somewhat less in summer and somewhat 
              more in winter, and about right (maybe slightly low) over 
              oceans. In polar regions, ISCCP cloud amounts are probably too 
              low by about 15%-25% in summer and 5%-10% in winter. Comparison 
              of the ISCCP climatology to three other cloud climatolgies shows 
              excellent agreement in the geographic distribution and seasonal 
              variation of cloud amounts: there is little agreement about 
              day/night contrasts in cloud amount. Notable results from ISCCP 
              are that the global annual mean cloud amount is about 63%. Being 
              about 23% higher over oceans than over land. The magnitude of 
              interannual variations of local (280-km scale) monthly mean 
              cloud amounts is about 7%-9%.

              cloud amount errors, see Rossow and Garder (1993a).
