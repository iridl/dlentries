                             3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The 1*1 degree FPAR data set is an essential variable for the calculation 
     of photosynthesis, and the energy and water exchange between the Earth's 
     surface (in particular of vegetation) and the lower boundary layer of the 
     atmosphere. It also serves as an intermediate variable to calculate Leaf 
     area index (LAI), Roughness length (Z0), green fraction of total leaves 
     (greenness) and albedo (Sellers et al 1994, 1995). Note that FPAR refers 
     to the fraction of PAR absorbed by the green portion only of the canopy.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     FPAR: Fraction of Photosynthetic Active Radiation absorbed by green part 
     of vegetation.

3.3  Discussion.

     The derivation of FPAR fields depends on a near-linear relationship 
     between FPAR and Simple Ratio (a transformation of the NDVI) that was 
     found in theoretical studies by e.g. Sellers (1985) for a vegetation 
     canopy over a dark soil background. This near-linear relationship was 
     confirmed in studies during the FIFE field campaign for a grassland 
     (Hall et al 1992). The FPAR - SR relationship is driven by the very 
     different optical properties of green leaves in the red (high absorption) 
     and infrared (high reflection) bands. SR or NDVI relates less well to the 
     FPAR of the total canopy, the relationship is fairly strong for the 
     "green" FPAR.  In some cases (bright soil background), the NDVI - FPAR 
     relationship was shown to be near-linear, rather than the SR-FPAR 
     relationship. Results from other large remote sensing experiments will be 
     needed to obtain further information on this relationship. See also 
     Sellers 1985, Hall et al 1992, Sellers et al 1994, 1995 and papers quoted 
     from these.

                          4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

For the calculation we assume a linear relationship between SR and FPAR.  We 
further assume that the 98 percentile of the NDVI distribution of a vegetation 
type reflects fully "green" conditions, and an FPAR value close to maximum 
(0.95). For certain vegetation types, in general the short vegetation classes, 
it is not reasonable to make this assumptions, because these classes occur in 
environments that are sub-optimal for maximum vegetation development. We 
therefore merged the short vegetation types with classes that had a similar 
sza - P98 relationship (see FASIR document). Thus class 8 (shrubs and ground 
cover) was merged with class 1 and 6, we applied  the 98 % values of classes 
2-5 combined to class 10 (tundra), and we used the 98 % values of agriculture 
for the short types 7 (grassland, 9 (ground cover over bare soil), and 11 
(bare soil) (see Sellers et al 1994). We used one minimum NDVI value for all 
cover types. This value is the 2 percentil of the NDVI distribution of classes 
9 (shrubs with bare soil) and 11 (bare soil).

     (Sellers et al 1994, 1995)

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            Two data sets are used for the calculation of
            FPAR.

            1. 1*1 degree FASIR- NDVI data set (FASIR87)
            2. land cover classification (VEG_CLSS.VGC)

            calculation of FPAR from FASIR data

                    FPAR = (0.95-0.001)(SR - SR02)/(SR98 - SR02) + 0.001
                    truncate such that 0.001 <= FPAR <= 0.950

            where
                    SR = (1+NDVI)/(1-NDVI) (is the simple ratio
                    NDVI = FASIR NDVI
                    SR98 = 98 % SR of a particular land cover class for 
                           overhead sun SR02 =  2 % SR of desert (bare soil) 
                           for overhead sun

            SR98 and SR02 values are calculate from NDVI 98% and 02% in the 
            table.

            IV refers to land cover class, see Documentation VEG_CLSS.VGC

10.1  Sources of Error

      1. Errors inherited from other data sets (see NDVI and FASIR - NDVI)

      2. Errors in classification (see VEG_CLSS.VGC).

      3. Assumption that 2% and 98% values for a vegetation type represent 
         conditions with FPAR of 0.001 and 0.95.

      4. Assumption that SR and FPAR relationship is linear, this linear 
         relationship is supported by model studies that use a dark soil 
         background. For a light soil background, it is the relationship 
         between NDVI and FPAR that appears to be more linear, rather than the 
         SR - FPAR relationship.

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              A rigorous verification of FPAR has still to be done and will be 
              subject of future studies (Sellers et al 1994, 1995).
