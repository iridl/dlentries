           cover classification at global scales. International Journal of 
           Remote Sensing, 15:3567-3586. Special Issue on Global Data Sets.

                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The data set was developed to explore the conceptual and methodological 
     issues that arise when using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 
     (NDVI) as a basis for global classification of vegetative land cover.  
     The purpose of the study is to use satellite data to improve currently 
     available information on global land cover for applications to global 
     change research.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     The data set describes the geographic distributions of eleven major
     cover types based on interannual variations in NDVI (see section 
     8.2 for listing of cover types included).  Vegetation-type dependent 
     parameters as used in SIB2 are included in this documentation, see 
     section 11.

3.3  Discussion.

     Phenological differences among vegetation types, reflected in temporal
     variations in NDVI derived from satellite data, have been used to 
     classify land cover at continental scales.  This study explored 
     methodologies for extending this concept to a global scale.  A coarse 
     resolution (one by one degree) data set of monthly NDVI values for 1987  
     (Los, et al. 1994, Sellers, et al. 1994, 1995b) was used as the basis 
     for a supervised classification of eleven cover types that broadly 
     represent the major biomes of the world. Because of missing values at 
     high latitudes, the Pathfinder AVHRR data set for 1987 (James and 
     Kalluri, 1994)  for summer monthly NDVI and red reflectance values were 
     used to distinguish the following cover types: tundra, high latitude 
     deciduous forest and woodland, coniferous evergreen forest and woodland.

     The eleven cover types were selected primarily to conform with the cover 
     types required as input to climate models.  Training sets for each of the
     eleven cover types were identified as the areas where three existing 
     ground-based data sets of global land cover (Matthews 1983, Olson, et 
     al. 1983, Wilson and  Henderson-Sellers 1985) agree that the land cover 
     is present.

     The global land cover data set is the result of a maximum likelihood 
     classification of eleven cover types.  The data set has not been
     systematically validated.  Cursory validation indicates that the user
     should be aware of the following problems: 1) the distinction between 
     "cultivated" and "grassland" cover types may be inaccurate because the
     NDVI temporal profiles of these two cover types are not significantly 
     distinct, and 2) the "tundra" cover type may be inaccurate because of
     missing data at high latitudes.

5.1  Instrument Description.

     The global land cover data set was based on AVHRR maximum monthly 
     composites for 1987 of NDVI values at approximately 8 km resolution, 
     averaged to one by one degree resolution  (Los, et al. in press) .  A 
     Fourier transform was applied to smooth the temporal profiles and remove 
     aberrant low values (Sellers, et al. 1994, 1995b) .  At high northern 
     latitudes, the data set was based on the AVHRR Pathfinder data set for 
     1987  (James and Kalluri, 1994), resampled to a spatial resolution of 
     one by one degree and composited to obtain maximum monthly NDVI values 
     and corresponding red reflectance values for summer months.

The data values in the first column are consistent with SiB vegetation classes 
(Dorman and Sellers, 1989).  It was not possible to separate SiB vegetation
classes 6 (broadleaf trees with groundcover) and 8 (broadleaf shrubs with
groundcover) using the classification method described here.  Class 6, 
therefore, includes both types, and there are no class 8 values in the data 
set.

In the SiB2 GCM application of Sellers et. al. (1995a, b) and for the purpose
of producing the NDVI related data sets elsewhere on the CD-ROM, this
classification is simplified to the right-hand column, where most
tropical seasonal biomes are assigned C4 grassland properties and temperate 
biomes with c3 ground cover are assigned cultivation properties. For the
FASIR corrections (see FASIR document elsewhere on the CD-ROM) classes 1,6 and
14 were merged and represented classes 1, 6, 8 and 14, classes 2 and 3 were 
merged, class 4 represented class 4 and 5 and class 12 represented classes 
7,9,10,11,12 and 15.

The cover class descriptions used in DeFries and Townshend (1994a) differ 
somewhat from the classes shown in Table 8.2.2. Their method resolved 11 
classes which are regrouped into SiB classes as shown in the following Table.

                         9.  DATA MANIPULATIONS

9.1  Formulas.

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.

            Maximum likelihood classification based on 12 monthly NDVI values
            was used to obtain the global land cover data set.  In outline,
            the maximum likelihood procedure classifies each pixel to the land
            cover type that it most resembles in terms of its remotely sensed
            properties.  The remotely sensed properties are used to define a 
            multi-dimensional space within which pixels of each cover type can 
            be located. The mean vector and variance-covariance matrix for 
            each cover type are estimated using its worldwide population of 
            pixels from the training set. Then, using the maximum likelihood 
            rule (Swain and Davis 1978), the multidimensional space is 
            partitioned into sub-spaces each uniquely associated with one land 
            cover type.  The whole of the global land mass is then classified 
            according to the remotely sensed properties of each pixel.  Thus, 
            if a pixel falls within the sub-space associated  with cover type 
            ci, it is labeled ci.  If the pixel falls within the sub-space 
            associated with cover type cj, it is labeled as that cover type, 
            cj.

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            To account for phasing of seasons, maximum likelihood 
            classification was based on monthly NDVI values sequenced from the 
            peak value at each pixel (see DeFries and Townshend  (1994a)  
            for more detail).

            Training sets for each of the eleven cover types were
            identified as the areas where three existing ground-based data 
            sets of global land cover (Matthews 1983, Olson, et al. 1983, 
            Wilson and Henderson-Sellers 1985) agree that the land cover is 
            present.  Although there is considerable disagreement among these 
            data sets  (DeFries and Townshend 1994b), the locations where the 
            three data sets agree were selected as those with the greatest 
            confidence that the cover type actually exists on the ground.  The 
            following steps were taken to ensure that each training set was as 
            spectrally distinct as possible or to further subdivide the 
            training set so that each would be spectrally distinct:

            1) each training set was split into Northern and Southern 
               Hemispheres to account for phasing of seasons in the two 
               hemispheres.

            2) the feature space occupied by each training set was visually
               examined.  Pixels that were obvious outliers were removed, and
               clusters were examined to determine if they were falling in 
               different geographic areas.  Where this was the case, the 
               training set was subdivided.  The most obvious example where 
               subdivision was required was cultivated crops whose spectral 
               signatures vary considerably among continents.

            3) Bhattacharrya Distances--a measure of the separability of the 
               training sets--and overlaps in the feature space were examined 
               to determine if some cover types should be combined.  This was 
               the case, for example, for Southern Hemisphere broadleaf 
               deciduous forest located mainly in Africa and Southern 
               Hemisphere wooded grassland.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            The global land cover data set was modified from the original 
            maximum likelihood classification result as follows to eliminate 
            stray pixels that were obviously incorrectly classified:  pixels 
            falling within training areas that were not correctly classified 
            were changed to the cover type indicated by the training area;  
            pixels surrounded on all sides by a different cover type were 
            changed to that cover type; pixels classified as broadleaf 
            evergreen in mid-latitudes were changed to the wooded grassland 
            cover type; pixels classified as coniferous evergreen within the 
            tropics were changed to the broadleaf evergreen cover type; pixels 
            classified as mixed deciduous and evergreen forest and woodland 
            within the tropics were changed to the wooded grassland cover 
            type.  In total, these changes altered approximately 10 percent of 
            the total land surface.
            
            The following modifications have been made to the global land
            cover data set by:
            
            G. James Collatz and Sietse Los, Biospheric Sciences Branch,
            Code 923, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt MD 20771.
            
            The land cover data set was further modified to be consistent with 
            the SiB vegetation classes described in Dorman and Sellers, 
            (1989), Sellers et. al. (1995a) and Sellers et. al. (1995b) in the 
            following ways:
            
            a) The Matthews (1983) vegetation map is used as the global 
               land/ocean mask except for Africa where Kuchler (1983) is used.  
            
            b) Vegetation class 8 (broad leaf shrubs and ground cover) was not 
               distinguishable from class 6 (wooded grassland) using the 
               classification methods described here so class 6 includes both 
               wooded grasslands and shrubs with groundcover understory.
               
            c) The original classification data set had 90 missing points in
               Arctic that are classified as land points in the land/ocean 
               mask.  These were set to class 11 (bare ground). Two other 
               points not classified lie in the southwestern Pacific 
               (latitudinal index, longitudinal index=94,329 and 94,330).  
               These points are set to class 1 to match an adjoining point 
               that had been classified.
               
            d) Class 6 (wooded c4 grassland) and class 7 (c4 grasslands) 
               occurring in regions with climates unfavorable for c4 grasses 
               were reclassified to class 14 (wooded c3 grassland) and class 
               15 (c3 grasslands) respectively.  The main criteria for 
               deciding whether the climate is favorable for c4 grasses are 
               that the following two conditions apply for any month at that 
               grid point: a) mean monthly temperature is above 22 degree C 
               and b) mean monthly precipitation is above 25mm.  The mean 
               monthly temperature and precipitation fields were from Leemans 
               and Cramer (1991).

                          10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      Wintertime NDVI values were missing for large areas in high latitudes in 
      the primary data set used for this study  (Los, et al., 1994) .  For 
      these areas, results from a maximum likelihood classification using 
      AVHRR Pathfinder data (James and Kalluri, 1994) for summertime monthly 
      NDVI and red reflectance values were used.

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              The data set has not been systematically validated.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              Cursory validation indicates that the user should be aware of 
              the following problems: 

              1) the distinction between "cultivated" and "grassland" cover 
                 types may be inaccurate because the NDVI temporal profiles of 
                 these two cover types are not significantly distinct.

              2) the "tundra" cover type may be inaccurate because of missing 
                 data at high latitudes.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              Not available.

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

              None.

11.3  Other Relevant Information.

      The following two tables (Biome dependent and Biome independent
      parameters) were compiled by G. James Collatz, Code 923, NASA/GSFC,
      Greenbelt MD 20771, phone: 301-286-1425, e-mail: 
      jcollatz@biome.gsfc.nasa.gov

      Tables: Time-invariant land surface properties. These can be used in
      conjunction with the vegetation classification to specify global
      parameter fields. Most parameter fields are derived for use in the 
      Simple Biosphere model (SiB2; see Sellers et al., 1994, 1995b and 
      Sellers et al., 1995a,b and papers referenced) and may need to be 
      adapted for use in other models. (Parameters are from Sellers et al., 
      1995a,b).

*Soil reflectance for areas with bare soil are specified according to ERBE
data which is available elsewhere on this CD ROM.

**Minimum leaf resistance is the light saturated, unstressed resistance to 
water vapor diffusion through the leaf surface.  It is calculated using table 
values of V_max and m and the photosynthesis and stomatal models described in
Collatz et. al. 1991, Agric. For. Meteor., 54:107-136.  The total canopy 
resistance can be calculated using the minimum leaf resistance scaled by 
environmental conditions and integrated over all the leaves in the canopy.  
A simple way to perform the integration would be to multiply the environment-
modified minimum leaf resistance by the leaf area index (LAI) or by the 
fraction of incident PAR that is absorbed by the canopy (FPAR).  Global fields
of LAI and FPAR are available elsewhere on this CD-ROM.
