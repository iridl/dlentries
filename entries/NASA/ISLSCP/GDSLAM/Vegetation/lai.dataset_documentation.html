                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose

     The 1 X 1 degree leaf area index (LAI) global data set was compiled for 
     use within the simple biosphere model (SiB2, see Sellers et al., 1994, 
     1995), to calculate the energy and water exchange between the biosphere 
     and atmosphere. With the SiB calculations the effect of vegetation on 
     climate can be incorporated in a General Circulation Model (GCM) of the 
     atmosphere.

                          4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The FPAR - LAI relationship is assumed exponential for vegetation evenly 
distributed over a surface (Monteith, 1973) and linear for vegetation 
concentrated in clusters (Huemmrich and Goward, 1992), likely to occur in 
classes 4, 5, and 9, see the documentation on vegetation classification in 
VEG_CLSS.DOC section 8 and Defries and Townshend (1994). We tied the 
relationship between FPAR and LAI to these two points, an FPAR of 0.95 is 
equivalent to the maximum LAI for a particular class, an FPAR of 0.001 is 
equivalent to a minimum LAI. The minimum and maximum LAI values are presented 
in the table in section 9.

                                   6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     The 1 X 1 degree LAI data set is calculated from the 1 X 1 degree global 
     FPAR data set, the VEG_CLSS.VGC data and a look-up table (section 9.2.1).

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in each  file are ordered from North 
            to South and from West to East begining at the international 
            dateline.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered at 89.5 N 
            and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution. 

            The data are given in an equal-angle grid that has a spatial 
            resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            January 1987 through December 1988.

     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution.

            Monthly mean.

10.1  Sources of Error.

      1. Errors inherited from other data sets (see NDVI,
         FASIR and FPAR data sets).

      2. Assumptions on LAI - FPAR relation, Note: LAI is not as
         critical a parameter in the calculation of heat and water
         exchange as FPAR.

10.2  Quality Assessment. 

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source. 

              A point-area level verification of these LAI fields has yet
              to be made (Sellers et al., 1994, 1995).  The numbers obtained
              are generally lower than those from point measurements 
              reported in the literature, possibly because these were
              derived for fairly idealized situations.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment. 

              See FASIR, NDVI and FPAR documents. The numbers obtained
              are generally lower than those from point measurements 
              reported in the literature, possibly because these were
              derived for fairly idealized situations. There is evidence
              that the relationship between NDVI and LAI is fairly weak,
              and by no means as strong as the relationship between FPAR
              and NDVI. Hence, we have more confidence in the FPAR fields
              than in the LAI fields. The LAI values are fairly sensitive
              to changes in the NDVI (e.g. as a result of corrections) or
              changes in the estimation of the 98 % values of the NDVI
              distributions (see FASIR documentation).

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              See the NDVI, FASIR and FPAR documentation.

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.
