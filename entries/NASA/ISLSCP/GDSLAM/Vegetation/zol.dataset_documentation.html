                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose

     The 1 X 1 degree roughness length (Zo) data set was compiled to calculate 
     the energy and water exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere with 
     the simple biosphere model. (SiB2) (Sellers et al. (1995a). With the SiB2 
     calculations the effect of vegetation on climate can be incorporated in a 
     General Circulation Model (GCM) of the atmosphere.

3.2  Summary of Parameters

     Z0: (Z subscript naught) Roughness length
     see also section 3.3

3.3  Discussion.

     Roughness length is calculated using a one-dimensional, first-order 
     turbulent transfer model (Sellers et al 1989, 1995a). The parameters 
     involved in calculating Zo are:

     LAI = leaf area index                 m^2 m^-2
     Cd  = leaf drag coefficient                  m
     Z2  = canopy top height                      m
     Z1  = canopy base height                     m
     Zs  = soil/litter layer roughness length     m


                          4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The first-order closure model of Sellers et al. (1989, 1995a) is applied 
repeatedly to the vegetation properties subset of morphological parameters, 
e.g., vegetation height, leaf morphology, etc., to create look-up tables of 
roughness length Zo, for each vegetation type. The model is cycled to produce 
values of this parameter for each vegetation type for leaf area indices 
ranging from [0] to [8.0] in [0.5] increments.  This look-up table (section 
9.2.1) is relationally combined with the LAI fields and land cover map 
(VEG_CLSS.VGC) to produce 1 X 1 degree monthly fields of Zo. Linear 
interpolation is used between the look-up table values.

$ The range in roughness values is dependent on vegetation class, see table in 
  section 92.  A minimum value of 0.02 has been inserted into the ROUCHNESS 
  data sets for regions (Antarctic, Greenland...) that are classified as 
  missing data in the NDVI data set (see NDVI.DOC).  Note: some of these 
  regions have no vegetation.
* The roughness data was derived from 1 X 1 degree global LAI data set and 
  land cover data set discussed Sellers et al (1994, 1995b).

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     In adition to the description given below see the description in (Sellers 
     et al 1994, 1995b)

     Two data sets and a lookup-table (below) are used for the calculation of
     roughness length.

     1. 1 X 1 degree LAI data set
     2. land cover classification (VEG_CLSS.VGC)
     3. The turbulent transfer model is run off-line repeatedly for different
        vegetation types over a range of Leaf Area Index values to generate a
        lookup table (see below).

     Specification of Zo is done by linear interpolation of roughness length
     values that are known for a particular LAI and vegetation type (see 
     below).
     For example,
     given LAI = 3.25, vegetation type = 1 (broadleaf evergreen),
     Zo = (3.25 - 3.0)*(2.99 - 2.99) + 2.99 = 2.99

                                   10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error

         Known errors are those inherited from other data sets, first order 
         dependence on errors in VEG_CLSS.VGC, second order dependence on 
         errors in leaf area index (see NDVI, FASIR and FPAR, LAI and 
         VEG_CLSS.VGC data sets).

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              A rigorous verification of Zo has still to be done (Sellers et 
              al 1994, 1995b).

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              The roughness length data have a first order dependency on land 
              cover type, and depend only to a minor degree on leaf area 
              index. Hence, the values will be very sensitive towards errors 
              in the vegetation classification and the inability to address 
              mixtures of types with a land cover classification. Especially 
              in dense woodlands (included in type 6) roughness lengths are 
              low, whereas in reality they can approach values of the 
              evergreen broadleaf forests Additionally, it is assumed that 
              each grid cell is uniformly covered by one vegetation class and 
              LAI value. In practice, heterogeneity's combine in a non-linear 
              way to yield different aggregate roughness values than those 
              arrived at by simple averaging, as in this case.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              See VEG_CLSS.VGC and above.

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.
