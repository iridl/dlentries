                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The 1 X 1 degree Greenness data set was compiled to calculate the energy 
     and water exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere with the simple 
     biosphere model (SiB).  With the SiB calculations the effect of 
     vegetation on climate can be incorporated in a General Circulation Model 
     (GCM) of the atmosphere.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Greenness: Percentage green leaves of total leaves (green and dead)

3.3  Discussion.

     The greenness (GREENNSS) derived from the FASIR-NDVI product is used with 
     the land cover map (VEG_CLSS.VGC) and a set of live and dead leaf optical 
     properties assigned to each vegetation type to create within SiB2 
     weighted (by live / dead fraction) leaf optical properties for each grid 
     area for each month (Sellers et al., 1994, 1995).

                          4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

An estimate of the proportion of dead leaves within the canopy is provided by 
the method originally used by Dorman and Sellers (1989) for SiB1. It is 
assumed that when the canopy is growing, all the leaves are green. After the 
maximum leaf area is reached, and the canopy starts to lose green leaves, the 
greenness fraction is determined by assuming that dead leaves remain within 
the canopy for one month before falling off or being eaten.

     global FPAR and VEG_CLSS.VGC data set.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics. 

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage. 

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from North 
            to South and from West to East begining at the international 
            dateline.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered at 89.5 N 
            and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution. 

            The data are given in an equal-angle grid that has a spatial 
            resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics. 

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            January 1987 through December 1988.

*GREENNESS Units are non-dimensional, a percentage between 0 and 100.  A 
 minimum value of 14.2 has been inserted into the GREENNESS data sets for 
 regions (Antarctic, Greenland...) that are classified as missing data in the 
 NDVI data set (see NDVI.DOC). Note: some of these regions have no vegetation.

10.1  Sources of Error.

      1. Errors inherited from other data sets (FASIR, FPAR, assumptions in 
         calculation of LAI).
      2. assumptions underlying calculation (e.g. that dead leaves remain on 
         vegetation for 1 month).
      3. fixed value for the STEM parameter from the lookup-table (9.2.1).

10.2  Quality Assessment. 

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              A rigorous verification of GREENNESS has still to be made 
              (Sellers et al., 1994, 1995).

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment. 

              Greenness is not thought to be very accurate.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables

              See NDVI, FASIR, FPAR and LAI documents.

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.
