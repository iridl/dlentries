                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The purpose of ECMWF level III-A atmospheric data are to support projects 
     associated with the World Climate Research Program (WCRP).

     The hybrid radiation (and precipitation) products were generated to 
     provide high temporal resolution forcing fields for land-atmosphere 
     models.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     The ECMWF products include:

     Surface pressure, temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, 
     shortwave and longwave net radiation fluxes, sea level pressure, sensible 
     and latent heat flux, wind stress, soil moisture, soil temperature, snow 
     depth, albedo, and surface roughness.

     The hybrid products consist of incident longwave and shortwave radiation 
     fluxes and total and convective precipitation. (The precipitation 
     products are discussed in the NMC_GPCP.DOC document).

3.3  Discussion.

     The ECMWF, and ECMWF, NASA/LaRC data on the ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM 
     are comprised of the ECMWF/TOGA Advanced Operational Analysis Data the 
     ECMWF/TOGA Supplementary Fields data and a hybrid dataset using the 
     radiation fields within the ECMWF/TOGA Supplementary Fields and the 
     NASA/LaRC Surface Shortwave  and Longwave Radiation Fluxes data set.

     ECMWF/TOGA Advanced Operational Analysis Data Sets:

     This data set contains uninitialized analysis values at the resolution 
     of the data assimilation system in operational use at ECMWF. The Advanced 
     Operational Analysis Data Set, on the ISLSCP Initiative 1 CD-ROM, are 
     comprised only of the Surface and Diagnostic Fields.

     The original ECMWF Surface and Diagnostic Fields data set was represented 
     on a 320 x 160 grid, with a regular spacing of 1.125 degrees (lat/long) 
     between points along each row for the period January 1, 1987 - December 
     31, 1988. Grid point values were stored in latitude rows starting at the 
     north and working southwards; within each row values ran from west to 
     east, starting at the 0 degree longitude. All of the ECMWF Surface and 
     Diagnostic Fields Data sets, on the ISLSCP CD-ROM, have been converted, 
     by the Goddard DAAC, to a 1 X 1 degree equal angle lat/long grid, 
     starting at 90 degrees latitude North and 180 degrees longitude West (see 
     section 9.3.1).

          The Parameters from the Surface and Diagnostic Fields data set, on 
          the ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM set, are:

          Surface Fields

              surface pressure, surface temperature, soil moisture, snow 
              depth, mean sea level pressure, u- and v-components of wind at 
              10m, temperature at 2m, dew point temperature at 2m, deep-soil 
              wetness, deep-soil temperature.

          Diagnostic Fields

              surface roughness, albedo, climate deep-soil wetness, climate 
              deep-soil temperature.

     ECMWF/TOGA Supplementary Fields Data Set:

     The Supplementary Fields Data Set contains surface heat fluxes, net 
     radiation and u- v-stress derived from 6-hour forecasts used as "first-
     guess" for analyses within ECMWF's data assimilation system.  The 
     Supplementary Fields Data Set acquired from ECMWF were represented in the 
     same format, as the Surface and Diagnostic Fields Data set, described 
     above. All ECMWF Supplementary Fields Data Sets, on the ISLSCP CD-ROM, 
     have been converted, by the Goddard DAAC, to a 1 X 1 degree equal angle 
     lat/long grid, starting at 90 degrees latitude North and 180 degrees 
     longitude West (see section 9.3.1).

          The Parameters from the Supplementary Fields data set, on the ISLSCP 
          Initiative I CD-ROM set, are:

              surface flux of sensible heat, surface flux of latent heat, 
              surface shortwave radiation, surface longwave radiation, top of 
              the atmosphere shortwave radiation, top of the atmosphere 
              longwave radiation, and the zonal and meridional components of 
              the surface wind stress.

     Most of the near-surface meteorological data are taken directly from 
     forecast products generated by the ECMWF operational numerical weather 
     prediction model.  

     ECMWF requested that the following information be provided to users of 
     the ECMWF data:

        The ECMWF data sets are adapted to a specific model orography; the 
        data sets have biases which are only partially documented (reference 
        list).

        No surface observations of T, q, precipitation, nor surface wind 
        observations over land were used in the analysis.

        Model spin up can seriously affect the flux data.  All flux fields, 
        including total cloud cover, are first-guess fields (i.e. 6 hour 
        forecasts).

        All the time-evolving fields on this CD-ROM, such as soil moisture, 
        snow depth and deep soil parameters include no direct observations, 
        but evolve during the data assimilation cycle.

        The Technical Attachment to the Description of the ECMWF/WCRP Archive 
        should be cited by users in publications (see reference section).

     In addition to the routine products extracted from the ECMWF archive for 
     this data set, NASA/GSFC generated synthetic 'hybrid' 6-hourly incident 
     surface shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, and NOAA/NMC generated 
     'hybrid' 6-hourly total and convective precipitation rates.  As presented 
     on the CD-ROMs the data sets include:

            I.  Prescribed/Diagnostic Fields (see table in section 1.3),
           II.  Monthly (6-hourly) Forcing Fields (see table in section 1.3),
          III.  Diurnally-resolved (6-hourly) Forcing Fields (see table in 
                section 1.3).  (These include the hybrid products).

     The data in I are intended for reference rather than direct use by 
     modelers.  The data sets in II are suitable for forcing long time-step 
     models.  The data sets in III have been put together for the express 
     purpose of forcing energy-water-carbon land models.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The ECMWF level III-A global atmospheric data, are assimilated data resulting 
from the combination of atmospheric observations and model calculations.  No 
surface observations are used, so that the surface data provided on these CD-
ROM comes from the model simulations of surface processes, strongly 
constrained by observed atmospheric information and "a priori" surface 
climatological information.  These data sets are based on quantities analyzed 
or computed within the ECMWF data assimilation scheme.  The ECMWF data 
assimilation system in use in 1987 consisted of a multivariate optimal 
interpolation analysis, a non-linear normal model initialization and a high 
resolution spectral model which produced a first guess forecast for the 
subsequent analysis. Data were assimilated every 6 hours.  

There were frequent changes in the model (see section 9.2.2 for details), many 
involving surface processes, over the temporal period of the data on this CD-
ROM. Since the data on this CD-ROM is inferred from model calculations 
constrained by atmospheric data, artificial discontinuities in the data would 
be expected at the dates of model changes.

                          6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     The data sets described in this document were acquired by the Goddard 
     Distributed Active Archive Center (GDAAC) from the European Center for 
     Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     The original data was given on a regular lat/long grid that had a spatial 
     resolution of on a 1.125 X 1.125, with an origin point at the Greenwich 
     meridian (90 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude). The Goddard DAAC 
     converted this data to a 1 X 1 degree lat/long grid with an origin point 
     at the international date line (90 degrees latitude North, 180 degree 
     longitude West), see section 9.3.1 for additional information.

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from north 
            to south and from west to east beginning at 180 degrees west and 
            90 degrees north.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered 
            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            January 1987 through December 1988.

            The time period of 0000 GMT January 1, 1989 are included for the 
            following parameters:
              Temperature at 2 meters  (T)
              Dew-point temperature at 2 meters  (Tw)
              Wind magnitude at 10 meters  (U)
              Surface Pressure  (Ps)


     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution.

            ECMWF produces routine global analyses for the four main synoptic 
            hours 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT and global 10 day forecast 
            based on 1200 GMT data.  The Hybrids were produced at the same 4 
            synoptic hours.

            The data correspond to four temporal resolutions.  

            Time-invariant (fixed):

              Surface Roughness
              Albedo

            Monthly data, produced, by the Goddard DAAC, from the 6 hourly 
            daily data (see section 9.3.1):

              NOAA/NMC, GPCP, Hybrid Convective Precipitation

              These data are intended to be used as forcing data for Energy-
              Water-Carbon models.  In addition to the ECMWF products of Ps, 
              T, Tw and U, we have added synthesized hybrid products for 
              downward shortwave and longwave radiation, and total and 
              connective precipitation, generated by NOAA/NMC.  Documentation 
              (NMC_GPCP.DOC) on the precipitation hybrid products is provided 
              in a separate document.

            * denotes fields accumulated over 6 hours since start of each 
              ECMWF forcast.  The Goddard DAAC converted these fields to 
              [W] [m^-2] [s^-1].  The Hybrid radiation data sets also use 
              monthly mean radiation data from LaRC in their derivation (see 
              section 9.1.1).

8.4  Data Format.

     Compressed format:

     The ECMWF data has been compressed using Unix Compress.  Compress uses 
     the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized in "A Technique for High 
     Performance Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, IEEE Computer, vol. 17, 
     no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19.  Common substrings in the file are first 
     replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up.  When code 512 is reached, the 
     algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until 
     the limit specified by the -b flag is reached (default 16).  Bits must be 
     between 9 and 16.  The default can be changed in the source to allow 
     compress to be run on a smaller machine.

     The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the
     number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.  The 
     ECMWF data has been reduced by approximately 85%.  So watch out!!!

     The data described here can be de-compressed using the platform specific 
     programs listed below.

            OROGRAPHY (SURFACE GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT)

            Although ECMWF Orography (Surface Geopotential Height) is not 
            included on this CD-ROM, it is undoubtedly one of the most 
            important surface fields. Once defined it determines directly or 
            indirectly some other surface fields (temperatures for example) 
            and it has an important role in the analysis and forecast. 
            Therefore, a description on how it is derived is presented below.

            The model orography can be represented in terms of an area mean or 
            an envelope orography. It is calculated according to the orography 
            expression

            phi(s) = g [H(m) + [alpha][sigma]]

            where g = 9.80665 is the mean acceleration of the Earth's gravity, 
            H(m) is the mean height on the user-defined grid retrieved from 
            the US Navy summary data set (Tibaldi and Geleyn, 1981), alpha is 
            the proportion of standard deviation to be added to the mean 
            height over land points (alpha is not equal to 0 for an envelope 
            orography), and sigma is the standard deviation of mean height 
            defined for the same grid as H(m).


            I.  Prescribed/Diagnostic Fields

            ALBEDO

            The background land albedo is interpolated to the model grid from 
            the mean annual values of the climatology by Dorman and Sellers 
            (1989). The original albedo climate data is a yearly averaged 
            climate field, with a resolution of 1.875 degrees on a regular 
            lat/long grid (Preuss and Geleyn, 1980; Geleyn and Preuss, 1983). 
            The interpolated field is then filtered by the same Gaussian 
            filter as is used in the orography filtering.

            Since sea ice has an important role in defining the global albedo 
            it was necessary to derive an annual mean sea ice pattern. The 
            following constraints are then imposed on the albedo field: over 
            sea ice values are reset to 0.55; over open sea (water points) the 
            albedo is 0.07; over land points the minimum albedo must not be 
            below 0.07 and the overall maximum cannot exceed 0.80 (usually 
            over snow-covered areas).

            In snow covered areas this background albedo, is modified taking 
            into account the snow depth and temperature, masking by the 
            vegetation and the presence of ice dew. The albedo of the snow 
            covered part is set to vary between a minimum (0.4) at melting 
            point, and a maximum (0.8) at temperature T(o) - C(ST), {C(ST) = 
            5C}. Where T(o) is the ice melting temperature and C(ST) is the 
            temperature for the snow albedo.

            Finally, the albedo is modified for the parallel solar radiation 
            depending on the cosine of the solar zenith angle. The thermal 
            emissivity of the surface is assumed to be 0.996 everywhere, 
            giving a thermal albedo of 0.004.

            The albedo, values provided on the Volume 2 CD-ROM are a yearly 
            background climate field.  The ECMWF model alters this field 
            during the run according to the snow cover.

            SURFACE ROUGHNESS LENGTH

            The roughness length due to vegetation is an original climate 
            data set, defined on a regular 5 degree lat/long grid all over the 
            globe (Baumgartner et al., 1977), and therefore it must be 
            interpolated from the original to the user-defined resolution. The 
            total roughness length is calculated from a simple expression

            Z(o) = [Z(V)^2 + Z(H)^2]^0.5

            Where Z(V) is the roughness length due to vegetation on the user 
            defined grid and Z(H) is the roughness length derived from 
            orography parameters and is part of the US Navy summary data set. 
            The information about urbanization has already been built in to 
            Z(H), in such a way that for 100% urban area a value of 2.5 meters 
            is assumed.


            SURFACE SOIL WETNESS (MOISTURE)

            This surface field is derived in a straightforward way from the 
            surface soil moisture climate data set. The surface soil moisture 
            climate data set is defined on a global 4 x 5 degree lat/long 
            grid and is available for the 1st and 16th day of each month 
            (Mintz and Serafini, 1981). The surface soil moisture climate data 
            are interpolated to a user-defined grid. The original maximum 
            value of the moisture that the soil can hold is set to 15 cm of 
            water.  Since, the first ground layer reaches only 7.2 cm in 
            depth, it is assumed that the maximum water content for this layer 
            cannot exceed 2 cm, and therefore all original values are scaled 
            accordingly.

            The field is of no relevance over the model water points, where it 
            is set to zero.

            DEEP-LAYER SOIL TEMPERATURE

            This field was derived from surface temperature which has been 
            obtained by the procedure described above. From the surface 
            temperature, deep-layer temperature is calculated using the 
            expression

            T(d)^n = [1-c]T(o) + c[aT(s)^n + bT(s)^n-1]

            Where T(o) denotes the mean annual surface temperature, T(s)^n and 
            T(s)^n-1 are the surface temperature for month n and previous 
            month n-1, a and b are constants defining the temperature phase 
            lag and c is a constant describing the amplitude damping. 
            Currently a = b = 0.5 and c = 0.77. The above formula applies only 
            over land points.

            DEEP-LAYER SOIL WETNESS (MOISTURE)

            This climate field is derived from the original data of Mintz and 
            Serafini (1981). The original soil moisture is first interpolated 
            to the operational Gaussian grid. The depth of the model's deep 
            (third) ground layer is 42 cm and the maximum water content in 
            this layer is assumed to be 12 cm. The deep ground layer overlaps 
            the middle layer, which begins at 7 cm and also has a depth of 42 
            cm. It is assumed that the soil moisture between these two layers 
            is in balance, since values used in the forecast model are scaled 
            to the depth of the first ground layer (which is 7 cm deep).

            SNOW DEPTH

            There are a variety of meteorological phenomena which have various 
            degrees of impact on snow creation and snow destruction. 
            Eventually, it was decided that only the combination of 
            precipitation and surface soil temperature over land points 
            would be considered when creating the snow climate.

            The Snow Depth is not calculated as a prognostic variable as in 
            most GCMs but is prescribed climatologically. The archived 
            climatological snow is not derived from snow measurements but is 
            derived according to some complicated semi-empirical modeling from 
            climatological monthly precipitation and temperatures. Since there 
            are now available, global climatologies of snow based on direct 
            observations, it is suggested that the user be cautious in use of 
            this unvalidated and indirectly derived climatology except to 
            understand how the archived albedos are derived.

            SURFACE TEMPERATURE

            A climatological surface temperature is derived according to the 
            procedure described by Brankovic and Van Maanen (1985).

            The procedure described below was taken from Brankovic and Van 
            Maanen (1985). A rather lengthy procedure is used to derive 
            surface temperature from the ECMWF model output.

            The data has been interpolated to the model resolution, used with 
            corrections for model elevation, and blended with the sea surface 
            temperatures and sea-ice of Alexander and Mobley  (Tibaldi and 
            Geleyn, 1971).  Since this data is based on early climatological 
            information no longer in general use and has been highly 
            manipulated to meet modeling requirements, it should be used with 
            caution except for understanding its role in derivation of the 
            time-dependent model surface fields.

            NASA/LaRC, ECMWF HYBRID SURFACE SHORTWAVE DOWN RADIATION

            This parameter was derived from the NASA/LaRC (monthly mean 
            radiation, on ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM Volume 1) surface 
            shortwave down radiation, ECMWF surface net shortwave radiation, 
            and ECMWF albedo.  The following equation was used:

            S(EH) = S(L)/SUM[S(NE)/[1 - A(E)]] * S(NE)/[1 - A(E)]

            where

            longwave net radiation, ECMWF surface net longwave radiation, and 
            ECMWF surface temperature data.  The following equation was used:

            L(EH) = L(NL)/SUM[L(NE)] * L(NE) + 0.996[b] * 
                    [T(SE(t)) + T(SE(t-1))/2]^4

            L(NE) = ECMWF surface longwave net radiation (6-hourly),
            T(SE(t)) = ECMWF surface temperature (at time = t),
            T(SE(t-1)) = ECMWF surface temperature (at time = t-1)

            HYBRID TOTAL AND CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION

            These products were created by NOAA/NMC using four input data sets 
            which are listed below:

                analyses for 1987/88 (available and documented on CD-ROM 
                Volume of this set).

            2)  The NMC Reanalysis global 1.875-degree 4DDA-based 6-hourly 
                total precipitation analyses for 1987/88, available from NMC,

                convective precipitation analyses for 1987/88, available from 
                NMC, (Kalnay et al., 1993; Kalnay et al., 1995).

            4)  The NASA/GSFC global 4x5 degree gauge-based daily 
                precipitation analyses for Dec 1978 through Nov 1979, 
                available from NASA/GSFC, (G. Walker, private communication, 
                NASA/GSFC, greg@rootboy.gsfc.nasa.gov; see also Liston et al., 
                1993, specifically Sec. 2.c, page 13).

            A detailed explanation of methods used to derive these data are 
            described in the file NMC_GPCP.DOC on ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM 
            Volume 1 & 5.

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            The ECMWF data assimilation system in 1987 consisted of a 
            multivariate optimal interpolation analysis, a non-linear normal 
            model initialization and a high resolution spectral model which 
            produced a first-guess forecast for the subsequent analysis. Data 
            were assimilated every 6 hours.

            The forecast model in 1987 used a spectral formulation in the 
            horizontal, with triangular truncation at total wavenumber 106, a 
            vertical coordinate with 19-level resolution which was terrain-
            following at low levels. The comprehensive physical 
            parametrization schemes included shallow and deep (Kuo) 
            convection, a radiation scheme which allowed interaction with 
            model generated clouds and the diurnal radiative cycle.

            ECMWF produces routine global analyses for the four main synoptic 
            hours 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT and global 10 day forecast 
            based on 1200 GMT data. The operational schedule with the 
            approximate running times of the analysis and forecast suite is 
            shown in the figure below. As a forecasting center with the 
            emphasis on the medium-range, ECMWF operates with long data 
            collection times of between 18 hours for the 1800 GMT analysis and 
            8 hours for the 1200 GMT final analysis. This schedule ensures the 
            most comprehensive global data coverage including the Southern 
            Hemisphere surface data and global satellite sounding data.

     9.2.2  Processing Changes.

            The section below summarizes the modifications to the ECMWF 
            operational data production system from January 1987 through 
            December 1988. This is the time period for the data in this ISLSCP 
            Initiative I data set collection.  For information on 
            modifications made before and after these dates see "ECMWF, The 
            Description of the ECMWF/WCRP Level III-A Global Atmospheric Data 
            Archive."

            3 February 1987   The humidity pre-processing was modified.

            10 February 1987  SATEM precipitable water content was included to 
                              analysis.

            7 April 1987      Forecast model cycle 29. The surface and 
                              subsurface parameterization scheme has been 
                              revised. Each grid box is now divided into 
                              vegetated and bare ground parts which concerns 
                              the evaporation over land surfaces. The time 
                              evolution of the soil water content takes root 
                              uptake, interruption of precipitation and 
                              collusion of dew by a skin reservoir, surface 
                              run off due to sloping terrain and gravitational 
                              drainage into account.

                              The use of specific thermal properties of snow 
                              modifies the surface temperature evolution over 
                              snow covered ground.

                              The convective Kuo scheme was modified. The 
                              accumulated convective precipitation now 
                              includes convective snowfall. Over sea surface 
                              convective precipitation is allowed to fall as 
                              snow when the sea surface temperature is above 
                              0 degree C. For both land and sea points the air 
                              temperature at the first model level is required 
                              to be colder than minus 3 degree C for snowfall.

                              The post-processing method to compute the 10 m 
                              winds, 2m temperature and dew point has been 
                              reformulated. The calculations of 10m wind 
                              components and the 2m temperature base on 
                              realistic profiles of wind speed and temperature 
                              gradients within the atmospheric boundary layer 
                              which is assumed to be a Constant Flux Layer 
                              (CFL). The variables (at any height) are 
                              obtained by integrating their vertical 
                              derivatives.

                              The 2m dew point depression is computed by 
                              assuming that the relative humidity is constant 
                              in the CFL.

                              The modifications of the near surface 
                              temperature give a more realistic simulation of 
                              the diurnal temperature variation under clear 
                              sky conditions. The old 2m dew point calculation 
                              suffered from a surface layer which was too 
                              moist which results in a too narrow dew point 
                              spread. The new scheme corrects this deficiency 
                              to a large extent.

                              In stable conditions the new post-processing 
                              give lower wind speeds u-wind and v-wind at 10m 
                              height.  The reduction which is of the order 1 - 
                              3 ms^-1 is in better agreement with locally 
                              observed winds.

                              Over sea the Charnock constant of 0.032 was 
                              replaced by the lower value of 0.018.

                              Soil moisture analysis is not being done any 
                              more. The initial soil temperature and moisture 
                              content are taken from the first-guess.

            13 April 1987     An error in the computation of 10m wind and 2m 
                              temperature and dew-point temperature was fixed. 
                              The data of u-wind 10m, v-wind 10m, 2m 
                              temperature and 2m dew-point temperature are 
                              incorrect within the time period from 7-13 April 
                              1987.

            16 June 1987      Land wind data in the Tropics were used and the 
                              wind direction check was tightened up.

            7 July 1987       An error in post-processing of low cloud and 
                              total cloud amount was fixed. The total cloud 
                              cover is incorrect from 15 July 1986 to 6 July 
                              1987 as a result.

            21 July 1987      A number of changes relating mainly to the use 
                              of SATEMs was implemented. Now 7 SATEM layers 
                              are used in the vertical instead of 11, i.e. 
                              1000/700 hPa, 700/500 hPa, 500/300 hPa, 300/100 
                              hPa, 50/30 hPa, 30/10 hPa.

                              The modifications allow better use to be made of 
                              satellite sounding data in agreement with the 
                              vertical resolution given by the satellite 
                              instruments.

                              The satellite observation statistics and 
                              quality control were revised.

            11 August 1987    A problem with the stratospheric SATEMs during 
                              early August caused the analysis to develop an 
                              erroneous warm dome in the 50-30 hPa thickness 
                              field over the Antarctic which was fixed on 11 
                              August.

            27 October 1987   Observations at North Pole were included in data 
                              selection. The humidity analysis data selection 
                              criteria were made consistent with mass and wind 
                              analysis.

            8 December 1987   The first-guess rejection limit for winds was 
                              tightened and an asymmetric first-guess check on 
                              extra-tropical cloud track winds was introduced.

            5 January 1988    Forecast model cycle 30. A revised vertical 
                              diffusion scheme was implemented. The turbulent 
                              diffusion is now limited to below the top of the 
                              boundary layer except when static instability is 
                              generated. This modification restricts the 
                              vertical mixing to the boundary layer. The 
                              reduction of dissipation and momentum and heat 
                              mixing in the free atmosphere has a positive 
                              impact on zonal mean temperatures and reduces 
                              the zonal wind errors. The eddy activity becomes 
                              stronger.

                              Modest modifications in the parameterization of 
                              the surface processes were included. The 
                              revision of the numerical scheme affects the 
                              partitioning of the surface moisture flux in 
                              terms of water extraction from the various 
                              contributing reservoirs. The interaction between 
                              convective precipitation and surface hydrology 
                              was revised as well as the interaction between 
                              the radiation and both the canopy layer and the 
                              snow.

                              The new surface parameters are only marginally 
                              influenced by these changes except in the case 
                              when snow is melting. Now the surface 
                              temperatures are allowed to be positive even 
                              with snow on the ground.

            26 January 1988   Divergent structure functions were included in 
                              wind correlation's of the analysis. The 
                              divergent structure functions improved the 
                              analysis significantly especially in the Tropics 
                              but the improvements were found short-lived 
                              during the assimilation cycle.

            1 March 1988      The revision of the MARS interpolation software 
                              affects especially the surface orographic field 
                              of the ECMWF/TOGA Level III Basic Data Set.

            12 July 1988      To minimize the impact of bad data in the data 
                              assimilation system the quality control 
                              algorithm have been modified which includes a 
                              more efficient OI check of SATEMs in areas with 
                              sufficient non-SATEM data and a general 
                              tightening of first-guess and OI rejection 
                              limits.

                              The structure functions were modified, resulting 
                              in an increased effective horizontal and 
                              vertical analysis resolution.

            22 November 1988  Forecast model cycle 31. A modification of the 
                              surface scheme was implemented in order to 
                              correct some of the deficiencies of 2 m 
                              temperature forecast.

                              1.  The root profile was adjusted. The values of 
                                  the root percentage in each of the 2 soil 
                                  layers are now 50% (70%) intermediate layer 
                                  and a 0% (15%) in the climate layer 
                                  (percentage values within the brackets are 
                                  valid for the old scheme). In the absence of 
                                  precipitation no root extraction is allowed 
                                  from the climate reservoir.

                              2.  The background vegetation cover in dry 
                                  situations was changed. No plant 
                                  transpiration is allowed if the soil wetness 
                                  in the root zone is lower than a threshold 
                                  value. The background vegetation cover is 
                                  not decreased linearly to 0 when the root 
                                  soil wetness decreases to 0.

            14 December 1988  A change was made to the analysis, to 
                              prevent uncontrolled growth of spurious vortices 
                              at the top level of the model.

9.3  Calculations.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            Below is a description of the regridding procedures, performed by 
            the NASA Goddard DAAC, used on the ECMWF data:

            1)  Converted the original ECMWF (1.125 x 1.125 degree) grid point 
                to (1.125 x 1.125 degree) grid area. This was done by 
                averaging the four grid point corners for each grid area.
            2)  The grid area data values were then replicated along a 
                latitude by the factor that would result in a common multiple. 
                Since the target grid count for the gridded ISLSCP data 
                sets is 360 latitude grids by 180 longitude grids, the 
                factors 360 and 180 were used for replication.  Each original 
                grid value along a latitude was then replicated a total of  
                360 times.  Once a latitude band has been replicated, a set of  
                replicated grid values starting at the beginning of the 
                latitude band are summed, averaged and assigned to a grid cell 
                in the target grid.  This set of replicated grid cells for 
                determining the target grid parameter value is equal to the 
                number of total original grid cells along a latitude band.   
                For example, if the original grids cell count for a latitude 
                was 144, and the target count was 360, then the number of 
                replicated cells is 51840.  From these 51840 cells, 
                consecutive sets of 144 values are summed, averaged and 
                assigned to each of the target grid cells.  This method is 
                then repeated for each latitude band.
            3)  The results of the above steps are then taken, and each data 
                value along a longitude band is replicated using a factor of 
                180, and then summed, averaged, and assigned to the target 
                grid in much the same manner as before, then repeated for each 
                longitude band. 
            4)  The regridded (1 x 1 degree) ECMWF data were then used to 
                produce monthly 6-hourly means, monthly means, monthly 
                maximum, monthly minimum, and monthly Standard Deviation data 
                files for the appropriate data sets (see section 6.3.2).  The 
                monthly 6 hourly mean data were produced by adding a months 
                period of data for each of the four synoptic hours and 
                dividing by the number of days for that particular month.  The 
                monthly mean data were then produced from the monthly 6-hourly 
                mean data.

10.1  Sources of Error.

      The ECMWF data sets have biases which are only partially documented. 

      Many of the surface and diagnostic field data sets are adapted to a 
      specific model orography. For additional information on orography, see 
      Jarraud et al. (1988), and Miller et al. (1989).

      u-wind stress
      v-wind stress

      See Louis (1979) and Morcrette (1990), for information on sources of

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

              A comparison between 48-hour forecasts from the ECMWF model and 
              area averaged time series for the FIFE 1987 surface data was 
              made by Betts et al. (1993).  The comparison of the October 1987 
              data showed a consistent picture, reflecting five systematic 
              errors in the model.

              1)  The incoming short-wave radiation is too high in clear-sky 
                  conditions, perhaps by as much as 10%.  The fixed model 
                  albedo is lower than the data in October (the difference was 
                  less in August), but this may be unique to this grid point.

              2)  The ground-surface model, which has a 7 cm thick first 
                  surface layer, is too slow to respond to the net radiation 
                  after sunrise, and cools too slowly at night.  Since this 
                  layer must warm before the Sensible Heat transfer to the 
                  atmosphere can become upward, the model needs a very large 
                  downward ground heat flux after sunrise, as large as 200 [W]
                  [m^-2]. (The error is amplified by a time-truncation problem 
                  in the model.)  This introduces a day-time phase lag into 
                  the upward Sensible Heat flux, and appears also to result in 
                  a net heat flux into the ground, even as late in the year as 
                  October.

              3)  The difference between surface temperature and air 
                  temperature is too small in the model.  This is associated 
                  in part with having the same roughness lengths for heat and 
                  momentum in the model.

              4)  The model Latent Heat flux is near zero in October.  This 
                  results from ground-moisture values below the model 
                  threshold for evaporation (set at 30% of the soil field 
                  capacity).  These are kept low by the soil moisture 
                  specified in the climate layer for October.

              5)  The model Boundary Layer dries out as a result of having no 
                  surface Latent Heat flux.

              The Betts et al. (1993) analysis identified three possible 
              small biases in the 1987 model: they were each about 1-2% and 
              were all additive.

              1)  The parameterized version of the short-wave radiative code 
                  has an incoming flux 1-2% higher than a more exact narrow 
                  model.

              2)  The 1987 code did not include absorption in the shortwave 
                  by either the water-vapor continuum or aerosols; each of 
                  which might account for another 1-2% reduction in the 
                  incoming clear-sky shortwave at the surface.

              3)  The model's sensible- and latent-heat fluxes lag by about 2 
                  hours because of the slow thermal response of the 7 cm soil 
                  layer.  This is a result of the model's ground heat flux 
                  which is too high during the day-time heating cycle, 
                  reaching values in the morning of over 200 [W] [m^-2].

11.1  Known Problems With The Data

      U- and V-Wind Components at the Poles
      -------------------------------------
      In 1991 it was discovered that, on a regular latitude/longitude grid, 
      the ECMWF u- and v- components of wind were incorrect at the poles. The 
      problem was that the horizontal components of wind gave inconsistent 
      polar values of wind magnitude and direction. Changes have been made to 
      the interpolation routines used to create the ECMWF/TOGA Basic Data sets 
      and to extract data from the ECMWF/TOGA Advanced Data Sets and the 
      Supplementary Fields Data Set. These changes have had the following 
      effects on u- and v-wind fields at the poles:

             Surface data. The grid points at each of the poles will contain 
             horizontal wind components from the nearest neighboring Gaussian 
             latitude circle interpolated to the required resolution. For the 
             0.5625 degree lat/lon grid (current ECMWF model, 17 September 
             1991 onwards) model the nearest latitude circle is + or - 
             89.578132.

11.2  Usage Guidance.

      No surface observations are used, so that the surface data provided via 
      ECMWF comes from the model simulations of surface processes, strongly 
      constrained by observed atmospheric information and a priori surface 
      climatological information.

      There were frequent changes in the model (see section 9.2.2 for 
      details), many involving surface processes, over the temporal period of 
      these ECMWF data. Since the surface data are inferred from model 
      calculations constrained by atmospheric data, artificial discontinuities 
      in the data would be expected at the dates of model changes.

      Users of the Supplementary Fields Data Set should note the following 
      statement which was issued by the Research Department at ECMWF in April 
      1990.

           Users of the ECMWF low level wind data, in particular over the 
           oceans, should be aware of an inconsistency that exists between the 
           archived surface stress values and the stresses calculated 
           diagnostically from archived low level wind fields and 
           temperatures.

           Using the ECMWF parametrization diagnostically for example, 
           produces stresses that are higher than archived model values 
           because of the impact of the time algorithms used for the model's 
           boundary layer scheme.

11.3  Other Relevant Information.

      The data sets are adapted to a specific model orography; the data sets 
      have biases which are only partially documented (reference list).

      No surface observations of temperature, specific humidity, 
      precipitation, nor surface wind observations over land were used in the 
      analysis.

      Model spin-up can seriously affect the flux data.  All flux fields, 
      including total cloud cover, are first-guess fields (i.e., 6-hour 
      forecasts).

      Several fields such as soil moisture, snow depth, deep soil parameters, 
      although included in the analysis data set, are not analyzed but evolve 
      during the data assimilation cycle.

      should be cited by users in publications (see reference section).
