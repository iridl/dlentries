     Mitchell, K.E., and Y. Lin, 1994: Production of 6-hourly 
     continental precipitation data sets for 1987 and 1988 for ISLSCP
     Initiative I, Development Division, National Meteorological 
     Center, Washington, DC.

                       3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The objective of this data set is to provide a global continental 
     precipitation time series of relatively high temporal frequency.
     Its purpose is to fulfill the precipitation forcing needs of the 
     various land-surface/hydrology initiatives of the Global Energy 
     and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX), including ISLSCP, GCIP, GNEP, 
     and PILPS.  

     One chief application is in the initiative of the GEWEX Global Soil 
     Wetness Workshop (4-6 Oct 1994, Longmont, Colorado), which enlisted 
     a number of international land-surface modeling groups to utilize 
     the same global, continental atmosperic forcing data as input to 
     various land-surface process models to generate a set of global 
     soil wetness estimates for use in global climate models and other 
     applications.  A good discussion of the need for and approach to 
     a global soil wetness initiative is given by Dirmeyer (1995) in 
     his summary of a related forerunner meeting on soil wetness 
     (COLA, 19 Aug 94, Calverton, MD).

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     The data set provides global gridded 1-degree fields of 6-hourly
     total and convective precipitation for 1987/88.  Over a given
     month, the 6-hourly total precipitation sums up to the original
     monthly total of the GPCP data set.  As in the GPCP data set,
     all values over sea points (non-land mass) are set to zero.  
     The convective precipitation is always less than or equal to the 
     total precipitation for each 6-hour (and hence monthly) period.  

3.3  Discussion.

     The starting point for the generation of the 6-hour precipitation
     analyses here was the global 1-degree monthly land mass precipit-
     ation analyses of the GPCP, available as separate, independent 
     data sets in the ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM SET.  Briefly summarizing 
     the latter, the GPCP a) collects monthly precipitation totals 
     received in CLIMATE reports via the World Weather Watch GTS (Global 
     Telecommunication System), b) calculates monthly totals from 
     synoptic reports, and c) acquires monthly precipitation data 
     from international/national meteorological and hydrological 
     services/institutions. On the basis of these precipitation-gauge 
     measurements, 1-degree gridded analyses over land areas are 
     carried out using a spatial objective analysis method.  For 
     further documentation, refer to the documentation in this CD-ROM
     collection accompanying the GPCP monthly analyses.  Note that the
     GPCP analyses on this CD-ROM set and applied below are 1-degree,
     land-mass only, and based on surface gauge measurements only.  

     But the GPCP data sets provide only monthly total precipitation.
     To satisfy the GEWEX modeling needs discussed in Sec. 3.1,
     NMC agreed to partition the above GPCP monthly precipitation
     analyses into estimates of 6-hourly total and convective 
     precipitation time series, using the 6-hourly precipitation time 
     series of the global 4DDA-based NMC Reanalysis Project (Kalnay 
     and Jenne, 1991; Kalnay et al. 1993, Kalnay et al., 1995).  The NMC
     Reanalysis 6-hourly precipitation time-series are the source of the 
     derivation of temporal partitioning coefficients or weights applied to 
     the GPCP monthly precipitation totals.  Note that the NMC Reanalysis 
     precipitation is used only to derive weights for temporal partitioning, 
     so that the derived time series sum up over one month to the original 
     monthly GPCP amounts.

     The NMC Reanalysis provides an opportunity to estimate not only
     the 6-hourly time series of total precipitation, but also the
     time series of convective precipitation, since both total and
     convective precipitation amounts at 6-hourly intervals are
     routine products of the Reanalysis.  Here we embrace this 
     opportunity and derive a time series of 6-hourly convective
     precipitation from the 6-hourly total precipitation by applying 
     in each 6-hour period the Reanalysis ratio of convective to total 
     precipitation.  The user must bear in mind that the above ratio
     is a product of the physical parameterizations for stable and
     convective precipitation in the GCM of the NMC Reanalysis.  

                    4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The derivation of this data set begins with the GPCP gauge-based monthly 
precipitation analyses.  See the GPCP documentation (GPCP_PRC.DOC), for a 
description of the gauge measurements.

                      6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     Four input data sets were acquired to derive the final dataset described 
     in this document.  See Sec. 9 for a description of how these input data 
     sets were processed to derive the final data set.  

     The four input sets are:

     1)  The GPCP global 1-degree gauge-based monthly precipitation 
         analyses for 1987 & 1988 (available and documented on this CD-ROM 
         set).

     2)  The NMC Reanalysis global 1.875-degree 4DDA-based 6-hourly 
         total precipitation analyses for 1987 & 1988, available from NMC,
         (Kalnay et al., 1993, Kalnay et al., 1995).

     3)  The NMC Reanalysis global 1.875-degree 4DDA-based 6-hourly 
         convective precipitation analyses for 1987 & 1988, available from 
         NMC, (Kalnay et al., 1993, Kalnay et al., 1995).

     4)  The NASA/GSFC global 4x5 degree gauge-based daily precip
         analyses for Dec 1978 through Nov 1979, available from NASA/GSFC,
         (G. Walker, private communication, NASA/GSFC, 
         greg@rootboy.gsfc.nasa.gov; see also Liston et al., 1993,
         specifically Sec. 2.c, page 13).  Sec. 9.2.1 below provides
         more details on this data set.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     For each of the four input data sets listed in Sec. 6.1, 
     the spatial characteristics are as follows:

     1) GPCP Monthly Precipitation: global 1-degree latitude by 
        longitude.
                         
     2) NMC Reanalysis 6-Hourly Total Precipitation: global 
        1.875-degree latitude by longitude.  

        (Specifically a 192 x 94 Gaussian grid, commonly used in 
        global spectral models; the longitude increment is 1.875 
        degree, the latitude increment is slightly variable, but 
        nearly 1.915 degree.)

     3) NMC Reanalysis 6-Hourly Convective Precipitation:  
        same as 2) above.

     4) NASA/GSFC Daily Precipitation: global 4x5 degree latitude 
        by longitude (Dec 1978 - Nov 1979 only) 

     Again, we emphasize that the final derived data set is derived 
     from the above four input data sets as described in Sec. 9.

     The spatial characteristics of the final derived data set is 
     global 1-degree latitude by longitude.  This is described in
     more detail next in Secs. 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.      

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from North 
            to South and from West to East beginning at 180 degrees West and 
            90 degrees North.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered 
            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

            Only land-mass grid points have non-zero values.  All values over 
            water are zero (as in GPCP).  The 1-degree land/water mask is 
            available in this CD-ROM collection.

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The final data set is given on an equal-angle grid that has 
            a spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            The final data set covers the period Jan 1987 through Dec 1988.

     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution.

            The final data set is 6-hourly.

8.3  Sample Data Base Data Record.

8.4  Data Format.

     Compressed format:

     The ECMWF data has been compressed using Unix Compress.  Compress uses 
     the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm popularized in "A Technique for High 
     Performance Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, IEEE Computer, vol. 17, 
     no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19.  Common substrings in the file are first 
     replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up.  When code 512 is reached, the 
     algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and continues to use more bits until 
     the limit specified by the -b flag is reached (default 16).  Bits must be 
     between 9 and 16.  The default can be changed in the source to allow 
     compress to be run on a smaller machine.

     The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input, the
     number of bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.  The 
     ECMWF data has been reduced by approximately 85%.  So watch out!!!

     The data described here can be de-compressed using the platform specific 
     programs listed below.

            grid land mass point denoted (i,j), we denote the following 
            relative to the first three input data sets in Sec. 6.2:

            1.915 degree.  Our first operation is to bilinearly interpolate
            these horizontally to the 1-degree grid of the GPCP fields.  
            The above notation of RPTtt or RPCtt denotes 1-degree Reanalysis 
            fields after this interpolation.   

            Before applying the above 1-degree Reanalysis precipitation 
            fields, we first filtered the fields, as described next, to 
            eliminate an identified tendency for the Reanalysis to generate 
            too many days of measurable daily rainfall in the warm months over 
            the southeast portions of both the North American and Asian 
            continents.  This tendency is a product of the convective 
            parameterization scheme in the GCM of the Reanalysis system.  The 
            hydrological modelers who expect to apply the final 6-hourly 
            precipitation data set firmly urged us to take care in reproducing 
            observed frequencies of measurable daily precipitation.  
     
            To accomplish the filter, we needed a gauge-based, global,
            land-mass analysis of DAILY rainfall.  Such fields are not
            easily available on a global basis.  (Indeed it is the lack of 
            such gauge-based global daily precipitation analyses that led 
            to this very project to apply Reanalysis to monthly GPCP.)  One 
            exception is the data set 4) in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, 
            namely the NASA/GSFC gauge-based global 4x5 degree daily 
            precipitation analysis spanning the FGGE months of Dec 1978 
            through Nov 1979 (used in Liston et al., 1993).  Even though the 
            above analysis is for 1979, we decided its frequency of measurable 
            daily rainfall was more representative than that of Reanalysis.  
            Note that we apply below only the FREQUENCY in 1979 as a filter 
            threshold.  We do NOT use the order of precipitation events in the 
            1979 daily series as a source for the order of events in the final 
            1987 & 1988 data set here.  Rather the Reanalysis time series 
            (filtered below) will determine the order of 6-hourly precip 
            events.
     
            Thus for the same FGGE calendar month as the given month
            in 1987 & 1988 assumed above, we denote the daily, 24-hour 
            precipitation amount from the NASA/GSFC gauge-based global 
            analysis as
     
              NP24(i,j,k) - 24-hour precipitation amount for day k
     
            Following earlier practice, the above denotes the NASA/GSFC
            analysis after bilinear interpolation from 4x5 degree to the
            GPCP 1-degree grid.

            To accomplish the frequency filter, for each (i,j) land 
            mass point, we compute for the given month a) the number of 
            days, NR(i,j), in which RPT24(i,j,k) exceeded 1 mm and 
            b) the number of days, NF(i,j), in which NP24(i,j,k) exceeded
            1 mm.  If NF(i,j) > 10 (in order to target convective regions
            for the most part) and NR(i,j) > NF(i,j) then we iterated
            to determine a threshold daily precipitation amount, E(i,j), such
            that if RPT24(i,j,k) < E(i,j), then we set RPT24(i,j,k)=0
            and RPC24(i,j,k)=0 and hence also we set 

              RPT06(i,j,k,1)=RPT06(i,j,k,2)=RPT06(i,j,k,3)=RPT06(i,j,k,4)=0

              RPC06(i,j,k,1)=RPC06(i,j,k,2)=RPC06(i,j,k,3)=RPC06(i,j,k,4)=0

            for each such day k of the month satisfying the threshold, 
            with the result that after such filtering (month by month) 
            then NR(i,j)=NF(i,j) whenever NF(i,j) > 10.  Thus, at a given 
            grid point (i,j), if RPT24(i,j,k) is less than the threshold 
            E(i,j), then ALL Reanalysis precipitation amounts for that day 
            were set to zero.  Note that the threshold field E(i,j) was 
            determined separately for each of the 48 months in 1987 & 1988.  
            With few exceptions, the values of E(i,j) were less than several 
            millimeters. 

            We denote all such filtered Reanalysis fields as follows
            (for tt=06 and tt=24):

              RPTttF = filtered counterpart to RPTtt
              RPCttF = filtered counterpart to RPCtt
              RPTMMF = filtered counterpart to RPTMM

            At last, it is straightforward to derive the desired 
            temporally partitioned GPCP analyses.

            First, the 6-hourly partitioned GPCP total precipitation
            is derived for each day k of given month from

              GPT06(i,j,k,m)  = [RPT06F(i,j,k,m)/RPTMMF(i,j)] * GP(i,j)

            for each 6-hourly period m=1,2,3,4.  In the above we see that 
            the Reanalysis 6-hourly amount, scaled by the Reanalysis 
            monthly total, acts as the temporal partitioning or weighting 
            coefficient.  (Note: If GP(i,j)=0, then we set GPT06(i,j,k,m)=0.
            If GP(i,j) is nonzero and RPTMMF(i,j) is zero, we search for
            and substitute for RPT06F and RPTMMF from the nearest land 
            mass (i,j) at which RPTMMF is nonzero.)
           
            Secondly, the 6-hourly partitioned GPCP convective precipitation
            is derived for each day k of given month from

            GPC06(i,j,k,m)=[RPC06F(i,j,k,m)/RPT06F(i,j,k,m)]*GPT06(i,j,k,m)
     
            for each 6-hourly period m=1,2,3,4.  In the above we see that 
            the Reanalysis 6-hourly convective amount, scaled by the 
            Reanalysis 6-hourly total amount, acts as the convective 
            partitioning or weighting coefficient.  (Note:  If 
            GPT06(i,j,k,m) is zero, then we set GPC06(i,j,k,m)=0.
            If GPT06(i,j,k,m) is nonzero, then RPT06F(i,j,k,m) is 
            nonzero and hence GPC06(i,j,k,m) is well defined.)

                          10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      The final data set inherits errors from the four input data
      sets of Section 6.1.

      First, the monthly totals obtained by summing the derived 
      6-hourly time series agree with the input GPCP monthly 
      precipitation.  Hence these monthly totals reflect the 
      accuracy of the GPCP analyses.

      In particular, the procedures of Section 9 were specifically 
      designed to avoid having the monthly totals of this 6-hourly 
      data set reflect any of the biases in monthly totals in the 
      NMC Reanalysis.

      The sources of error in the input GPCP monthly precipitation
      analyses are discussed in Section 10 of the GPCP documentation
      in this CD-ROM set.  The reader should review all of that 
      information. 

      Within a given month, the temporal character of the 
      precipitation time series is dependent on the temporal character 
      of the NMC Reanalysis precipitation.  

      In the NMC Reanalysis, stringent care was given to quality 
      control (see Kalnay et al., 1993, and Kalnay et al., 1995).
      Nevertheless, as in any modern state-of-the-art multi-variant
      four-dimensional data assimilation system (4DDA), the NMC 
      Reanalysis inevitably embodies some systematic errors.

      The precipitation fields from the NMC Reanalysis have been 
      examined by external researchers and presented at the recent 
      Nineteenth Annual Climate Diagnostics Workshop, sponsored
      during 14-18 Nov 94 at College Park, MD by the Cooperative 
      Institute for Climate Studies at the University of Maryland.
      The results showed, for example, that the diurnal character 
      of the precipitation fields from the NMC Reanalysis compared
      favorably with observations in the spring season over the
      central U.S. and that this diurnal character was significantly
      better than an alternative non-NMC reanalysis product.

      On the other hand, in the NMC Reanalysis, researchers have found 
      that the frequency of measurable daily precipitation is too high 
      over the southeast portions of the North American and Asian
      continents.  Hence the frequency filter described in Section 9.2
      was applied.

      The resultant temporal character of the 6-hourly time series, 
      though having some of the limitations of a global 4DDA system,
      are nevertheless superior in our view for many applications to 
      the alternative of a researcher having to take the GPCP monthly 
      amounts and arbitrarily distributing these amounts across the
      monthly period (e.g., a constant mean 6-hourly amount for
      the whole month).  Furthermore, the Reanalysis-based time
      series are strongly linked to the regular progression of
      synoptic weather systems and convective triggers that
      characterize the real atmosphere.

      As cited earlier, the data set includes the 6-hourly time
      series for both total and convective precipitation.  Of
      the two, the total precipitation time series is more
      reliable, as the temporal character and relative magnitude
      of the convective time series is heavily tied to the
      convective parameterization scheme in the GCM of the 
      NMC Reanalysis system.  Some sensitivities of the Reanalysis
      precipitation to choice of convective parameterization scheme
      are presented in Kalnay et al. (1993).  Despite some NMC 
      reluctance to provide the convective time series, GEWEX modelers 
      strongly urged this present attempt, because their land surface 
      process models often require a partitioning between non-convective
      and convective precipitation, and once again 4DDA, or its
      Reanalysis equivalent, was viewed as the best reasonably 
      available means for providing this separation.

10.2   Quality Assessment.

       10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

               See Section 10.2.1 of the GPCP documentation for
               information on that source.

               The NMC Reanalysis precipitation has been compared
               on a global monthly basis with GPCP monthly analyses,
               with other precipitation climatologies, and with
               other Reanalysis products from other centers.  Regional,
               diurnal, and water budget characteristics have been
               studied by both internal and external NMC researchers.
               Since the Reanalysis products are very new, much of the 
               above research is not yet available in the commonly 
               available literature.  One exception is the study by
               Mo et al. (1995), who examined the sensitivity of the
               Reanalysis, including global precipitation analyses, to
               the use or omission of satellite data in the Reanalysis.
               Other very recent examples of Reanalysis fields are given 
               in Kalnay et al. (1995).

               Not applicable.

       10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

               In the final data set, the following checks were applied.

               1 - No negative values.

               2 - The summation over one month of the 6-hourly time
                   series of total precipitation agrees at every 
                   grid point with the original GPCP monthly amount.

               3 - The convective precipitation amount is always less
                   than or equal to the total precipitation amount.

               4 - All over water values (sea) are zero.

               5 - No missing flags (-99999.99) are present in either
                   the input GPCP monthly analyses or the final output
                   6-hourly time series.
