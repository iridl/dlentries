     Streamflow data of major river basins, Ver. 0, Dept. of Hydrology and 
     Water Resources, University of Arizona, in cooperation with Dr. Wolfgang 
     Grabs of the Global Runoff Data Center, Koblenz, Germany.

                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     The purpose of making this data set available is to give climate and 
     hydrologic researchers better access to the historical record of runoff 
     from some of the world's major river systems.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     This report includes the monthly average runoff from 129 gauging stations 
     for different periods of record, some of which span much of the last 200 
     years.  However, only 14 gauges fully cover the study period (1987 - 
     1988) of the ISLSCP Initiative 1.  These gauges were selected because of 
     the regional significance (not necessarily volume) of the river in 
     question. Gage location, contributing area and period of record are also 
     given.

3.3  Discussion.

     The hydrologic cycle is a critical component of global climate studies 
     but is poorly quantified globally in space and time.  Hydrologists have 
     used river runoff as a natural space/time integrator at the basin scale 
     for years and it is possible to extend this concept to larger scales 
     given the appropriate data set. The monumental task of locating, 
     acquiring, digitizing and editing runoff data from around the world is 
     being managed by the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) under the 
     auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as part of the 
     World Climate Program.

     The aim of this project is to provide a global data set for the 
     validation of climate simulations by global General Circulation Models 
     (GCM's) [Max Planck-IFM, 1993].
 
     The GRDC has made a portion of their data base of major world rivers 
     available to this CD-ROM data set. Of the rivers included in this 
     release, the full period of record is given and, where needed, daily 
     flows have been converted to monthly averages. Although these basins 
     represent less than 30% of the land surface area, they contribute 
     approximately 46% of the estimated annual global runoff of 40,670 km3 
     [WRI, 1990].
 
     While monthly average flow is appropriate for most model applications, 
     the presence of extreme events is not preserved so this data set will 
     be of less use to those interested in historical climate extremes.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

Stage-discharge relations (discharge ratings) at gauging stations are usually 
developed experimentally from measurements of stage and discharge.

The discharge ratings for a stream or channel may consist of a simple relation 
between stage and discharge, or for a complex situation, it may be composed of 
several relation curves defining discharge as a function of stage, slope, rate 
of change of stage, or other variables.

The stage-discharge relations developed at one point in time are usually not 
permanent nor do they often represent long-time conditions. Changes in the 
stream channel such as scour and fill or changes in channel roughness, aquatic 
growth, debris, or backwater from ice, all result in changes in the stage-
discharge relation. Hence, frequent discharge measurements are necessary to 
define the shape and/or changes in the discharge rating.

Discharge measurements are usually made by the current-meter method; however, 
it is sometimes necessary to resort to indirect measurements of flood flow 
(USGS Office of Water Data Coordination, 1977) to define the upper portion of 
the stage-discharge relation.

For additional information on stream gauging procedure, see Corbett and others 
(1945)

                            5.  EQUIPMENT

The equipment and methods used to measure streamflow probably vary 
substantially depending on the country and organization conducting the 
measurements.  The specific details for the gauges in this data set are not 
available at this time. For general information on equipment and methods used 
to measure streamflow, see (USGS Office of Water Data Coordination, 1977).

                          6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.
 
     This data was acquired from Dr. Wolfgang Grabs at the Global Runoff 
     Data Centre in Koblenz, Germany.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.
 
     Streamflow measurements were made at significant points in most major 
     river basins around the world. The contributing area above each gauge 
     and the gauge location are given in G_GAUGES.FLR (see section 8 for 
     details).

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.
 
            Streamflow measurements at significant points of the major river 
            basins around the world recording the cumulative output of the 
            contributing basin.

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data values represent an areal integration over the 
            contributing catchment.  The size of each catchment is listed in 
            the file G_GAUGES.FLR.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     A water year covers portions of two calendar years, beginning in October 
     of a year and ending in September of the following year. (e.g. wateryear 
     1991 consists of Oct-Dec of 1990 and Jan-Sep of 1991).

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            The period of record varies for each gauge.
            Over the entire data set:
 
            earliest wateryear      1807
            latest wateryear        1991
            latest starting year    1986
            earliest ending year    1961
            longest span            178 wateryears
            shortest span           1 wateryear

            Note: Only fourteen gauges fully cover the period 1987 to 1988.

8.1  Table Definition With Comments.

     The file G_GAUGES.FLR is a table that contains the gauge list (for all 
     gauges in this data set) with gauge number, gauge location and additional 
     information (see section 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4).  The G#######.FLR files, each 
     contain a table that has one record for every water year, consisting of 
     the water year and 12 flow rate values (one for each month of a year). 
     Each G#######.FLR file contains all the flow data for a specific gauge.

9.1  Formulas.

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.
 
            Where monthly averages had to be calculated from daily
            averages, an algorithm was employed to handle gaps in the daily
            record.  The days in the gap were linearly interpreted if
 
                a)   (# days in gap <= 20) & (%change < 10%)
             or b)   (# days in gap <= 10) & (%change < 50%)
 
            The daily values for a given month were then averaged if

                a)   # original measured values >=  2/3 # days in month
             or b)   (total # vals (meas.+interp) >= 3/4 # days in month) &

                1) (# meas >= 1/10 # days in month) & (cum. %change <= 10%)
             or 2) (# meas >= 1/2 # days in month) & (cum. %change < 50%)

            Otherwise monthly value classified as missing (-9999.00)
 
9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.
 
            Daily flow data were converted to monthly flow data using
            the algorithm in 9.1.1
 
            The monthly tables were reorganized from the January to
            December original order to a water year format of October
            to September.  Water years with at least one monthly value
            were retained and any missing values were filled in with
            -9999 as a no data value.
 
     9.2.2  Processing Changes.

            None.

9.3  Calculations.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            See section 9.1.1.

                          10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.
 
      Many gaps in the record were caused by freezing conditions,
      and ice bound flows. Standards of observation have changed through
      time but this information is not available. European observations
      during World War I and II, however, might be suspect. No corrections 
      have been made for the anthropogenic effects of damming and pumping but 
      these effects are often readily apparent (as on the Nile around the time 
      the Aswan High Dam was constructed). Climate modelers are cautioned that 
      this data set is not representative of all, particularly more arid, 
      regions of the world so reproduction of these runoffs, although 
      laudable, does not guarantee effective global climate simulation. In 
      addition, small basins are not well represented and likely would show 
      greater interannual variability.
