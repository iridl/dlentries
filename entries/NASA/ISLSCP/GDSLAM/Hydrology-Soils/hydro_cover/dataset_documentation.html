                             3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     This data set provides global areal coverage of different hydrological 
     terrains.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Ninteen types hydrological terrains.

3.3  Discussion.

     This is a global data set which contains hydrographic data on the areal 
     extent (coverage) of different kinds of terrain, and on the distribution 
     of mean terrestrial surface run-off. The data consists consists of 
     nineteen files, which are listed in section 8.2.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The hydrological coverage data was derived from published maps (see section 
12.2), by J.G.Cogley at Trent University.  This documentation does not 
describe the methods used to produce these maps.

     The hydrological cover data was aquired from J.G. Cogley at Trent 
     University.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics. 

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage. 

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from North 
            to South and from West to East beginning at 180 degrees West and 
            90 degrees North.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered 
            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution. 

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

      DSRF:
         DSRF is short for "dry surface". This field is simply the sum of the
         percentages in LAND, SWMP, DUNE and SMRS, and does not therefore 
         represent independent information.

      FRIV, IRIV:
         The stream frequency counts FRIV and IRIV were obtained by the same 
         process of recording information at grid intersections as outlined 
         above.  They should be interpreted cautiously, for they simply 
         represent the number of template intersections, out of a possible 
         total of 100, underlain by "blue-line features" on the map. They may 
         be influenced strongly by the habits of the various cartographers who 
         made the maps. The amount of blue-line detail on a small-scale map 
         appears to depend significantly on cartographic judgment or 
         preference.

         As for ILAK, no information is available on the frequency with which
         intermittent streams flow; however in IRIV the use of dashed lines at
         high latitudes was ignored. Streams which flow only in summertime, at
         latitudes where they would be expected to be frozen in winter, were 
         recorded as perennial streams.

      CRYO:
         CRYO is short for "cryosphere", of which CRYO portrays the main 
         features in a semi-quantitative way. In creating CRYO the first step 
         was to make a modified copy of MS05, in which cells containing more 
         than 90 percent glacier ice (from GLAC) were marked separately. These 
         glacial cells were then categorized as ice sheet or ice shelf, using 
         topographic information from another dataset and from maps of 
         Antarctica (there are no ice shelves in the Northern Hemisphere 
         sufficiently extensive to show up at 1x1 resolution). For non-glacial 
         land cells, the extent of permafrost was recorded in one of four 
         categories:

         absent or extremely restricted; restricted; common; ubiquitous.

         Of these terms, the last three correspond vaguely to the terms 
         sporadic, discontinuous and continuous, which are often used in 
         studies of the regional distribution of permafrost. However the 
         spatial resolution of GGHYDRO is coarser than that of most such 
         studies, and the traditional terms are used differently in different 
         studies. For these reasons it was

                   Table 2 - Character Codes in CRYO

               code                   Explanation
               ----                   -----------

                  0        No land
                  1        Permafrost restricted
                  2        Permafrost common
                  3        Permafrost ubiquitous
                  4        Permafrost absent or extremely restricted
                  7        Ice shelf
                  9        Ice sheet

         thought better to choose a new terminology -- some judgment was 
         required in allotting cells to categories when the sources of 
         information were mutually inconsistent and showed considerable fine-
         scale variability. 

         Note that "ubiquitous" means that permafrost is or is believed to 
         be"present beneath all exposed land surfaces", implying nothing about 
         the thermal state of the ground beneath bodies of water or glacier 
         ice. (In particular, subsea permafrost off the coasts of the Arctic 
         Ocean is not represented in CRYO.) The phrase "absent or extremely 
         restricted" is intended to embrace high mountain peaks in low 
         latitudes. Only a few such peaks are known to be underlain, or not 
         underlain, by permafrost, but its presence must be considered likely 
         beneath many of them.

         The principal sources of information for the distribution of 
         permafrost were maps in Kudryavtsev et al. (1978 - USSR), the 
         Hydrological Atlas of Canada (1978 - Canada), Washburn (1980 - 
         Alaska, Greenland), Pewe (1983 - contiguous United States), Fujii and 
         Higuchi (1978 - Mongolia) and Zhou and Guo (1983 - China).

         CRYO is one of the three fields in GGHYDRO which are alphanumeric as 
         opposed to numeric (the others being BAS1 and BAS2). That is, the 
         data are represented by characters rather than by numbers (Table 2), 
         as described in sections 2 and 3.

         This is the first release of CRYO, and is provisional. Although the
         major regions of permafrost in the high latitudes of the Northern 
         Hemisphere are represented from the best available sources, no 
         reliable information has yet been located on the presence or absence 
         of permafrost in the Andes, Patagonia, East Africa, south and 
         southwest Asia, or New Zealand. Exposed land in Antarctica has been 
         assumed to be underlain by ubiquitous permafrost.

      BAS1:
         BAS1 shows the major drainage basins of the world's landmasses, in-
         cluding regions of internal drainage; there is a special category for
         cells which are arheic, that is, cells from which there is no surface
         runoff. The drainage divides of about 200 of the world's larger 
         drainage basins were first transferred from topographic maps in The 
         Times Atlas of the World (1977) onto a cylindrical equidistant 
         graticule; maps of larger scale were consulted in areas of low 
         relief, and also in Greenland and Antarctica. The MS05 landmask was 
         also copied onto the graticule.  A coarse version of the system of 
         divides was then prepared by assigning

         each 1x1 land cell to one of a small number of composite basins, as 
         listed in Table 3. Only the largest features of the drainage pattern 
         can be shown clearly at a resolution of 1 degree, so that many 
         smaller basins of internal drainage remain undifferentiated.

         Cells with no surface water runoff were identified by relying on the 
         fields FRIV and IRIV: if there were no streams in the cell, and no 
         other evidence of surface water, it was assumed not to yield any 
         runoff. In Greenland and Antarctica the surface topography was used 
         as an indicator of the direction of ice "runoff".

      RNOF, RNER, RICE:
         These fields contain the annual average of surface water runoff from 
         land surfaces (in mm/yr), the estimated uncertainty in the surface 
         water runoff (in percent), and the annual average of "runoff" of 
         glacier ice (in mm/yr), respectively. The fields were derived from 
         maps in a considerable number of sources, of which Korzun et al. 
         (1977) was the most important.

      RNOF: 
         Because runoff is a dynamic quantity it is harder to measure 
         reliably than the static (or very slowly changing) fields of section 
         1a, and maps of hydrological quantities like runoff are therefore 
         less reliable than maps of hydrographic properties such as the extent 
         of salt flats or wetlands. For this reason a working resolution of 2 
         degrees by 2 degrees was adopted when transferring information from 
         runoff maps to digital storage, and an effort was made to quantify 
         the error in the runoff estimates. Transparent 2x2 degree graticules 
         were prepared to fit the source maps and were overlaid upon them, and 
         the runoff was estimated by eye for each 2x2 cell. Where runoff 
         isopleths were complex, numerous point readings were taken and 
         averaged. For cells containing large lakes, only the runoff from land 
         portions of the cell was recorded.

         Surface runoff is negative over some parts of the Earth's land 
         surface -- for example in the centres of enclosed drainage basins, 
         and in places where large rivers like the Nile flow across deserts, 
         losing water steadily -- but this phenomenon was not allowed for in 
         RNOF. (It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of the magnitude 
         of negative runoff, which will generally be small.) An estimated 
         runoff of 1 mm/yr should be taken to mean that the actual runoff is 
         probably indistinguishable from zero.  However where an element of 
         RNOF is 0 the implication is that the runoff is indeed zero, because 
         the cell in question contains no hydrographic evidence of surface 
         runoff (FRIV, IRIV, and other fields denoting the occurrence of 
         surface water, all being zero).

         The land mask for RNOF consisted of all 2x2 cells passing a 5 percent 
         threshold similar to that described above under MS05. However RNOF 
         itself, and RNER and RICE, are presented at 1x1 resolution: 1x1 land 
         cells in MS05 were assigned the runoff estimated for the 2x2 cell to 
         which they belong, and ocean cells were assigned runoff of zero. This 
         is a waste of storage space, but the inefficiency is outweighed by 
         the convenience of having a common spatial resolution for all fields 
         in the dataset.

      RNER: 
         The error estimates in RNER take account of three kinds of error:
         in the original measurements of stream discharge and water level; in 
         the preparation of maps like those of Korzun et al. (1977); and in 
         the con version of the mapped information to digital form. 
         Measurement errors are typically around ten percent, although better 
         measurements are possible when special care is taken; in addition 
         longer series of measurements are less uncertain than shorter ones. 
         Mapping errors arise from two main sources, interpolation and 
         extrapolation: the mapmaker must convert measurements of stream 
         discharge to estimates of runoff at points in between measurement 
         stations, and must also -- because the measurement network is not 
         complete -- extrapolate measured information to estimate the runoff 
         from regions where no measurements have been made. Digitizing error 
         arises mainly from the uncertainty in estimating spatial averages of 
         mapped runoff by eye. Mapping and digitizing errors were studied by 
         comparing the work of different mapmakers and map readers, and RNER 
         reflects the results of these studies (described in more detail in a 
         forthcoming publication). In particular, errors are greater in 
         mountainous terrain where measurement, mapping and map reading are 
         all more difficult than in areas of gentler topography, and errors 
         are made very large in very dry regions by requiring the absolute 
         error to be at least 5 mm/yr. This means, for example, that an 
         estimated runoff of 2 mm/yr has an estimated uncertainty of 250 
         percent.
 
         Cells with zero runoff, and cells in the interiors of the ice sheets, 
         have errors of zero, and ocean cells are assigned the meaningless 
         error of -999.

      RICE: 
         The runoff of solid water from Greenland and Antarctica was 
         estimated from maps in Reeh (1984), Giovinetti and Bentley (1985), 
         and other sources. These estimates must be considered highly 
         uncertain, although since the measurements are so sparse it is not 
         practical to make formal estimates of the error. It was assumed that 
         in the accumulation zones of the ice sheets the runoff is equal to 
         the annual accumulation of snow. In the ablation zone of Greenland 
         the solid runoff is highly negative because the ice gained by inflow 
         from the accumulation zone is nowhere near sufficient to balance the 
         ice lost by melting. The quantity recorded in RICE is a crude 
         estimate of the amount of summer meltwater runoff which comes from 
         glacier ice rather than from snowfall of the previous winter.
