                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     Develop high resolution gridded Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields 
     using in situ and satellite data.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Gridded monthly sea surface temperature.

3.3  Discussion.

     The National Meteorological Center (NMC) global sea surface
     temperature analyses use seven days of in situ (ship and buoy) and
     satellite SST.  These analyses are produced weekly using optimum
     interpolation (OI) on a 1-degree grid. The OI technique requires
     the specification of data and analysis error statistics. These
     statistics show that the SST rms data errors from ships are almost
     twice as large as the data errors from buoys or satellites. In
     addition, the average e-folding spatial error scales have been
     found to be 850 km in the zonal direction and 615 km in the
     meridional direction.

     The analysis also includes a preliminary step that corrects any satellite
     biases relative to the in situ data using Poisson's equation. The
     importance of this correction is demonstrated using recent data following
     the 1991 eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo. The OI analysis has been computed
     using the in situ and bias corrected satellite data for the period
     November 1981 to present.

     The monthly analyses presented here were computed by linearly
     interpolating the weekly fields to produce daily fields and then
     averaging the appropriate days within a month to produce monthly
     averages.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

     There are two main sources of SST measurements:  in situ and
     satellite.  The in situ observations are direct temperature
     measurements made from ships (roughly 80%) and buoys.  The ship
     observations are primarily (roughly 70%) made by measuring the
     temperature of water used for engine cooling.  Almost all the
     remaining ship measurements are obtained from thermometers placed
     in insulated buckets which have been thrown overboard and filled
     with sea water.  The buoy observations are made by thermistors
     which evaluate ocean temperature by either measuring the hull
     temperature of the buoy or measuring the temperature of the water
     directly.  The depth of the measurement varies from roughly 20
     meters (intake for engine cooling) to several meters (small
     buoys).

     The satellite observations are obtained by measuring the infrared
     radiation using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
     (AVHRR) on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
     Administration polar orbiting satellites. These data were
     produced operationally by NOAA's Environmental Satellite, Data
     and Information Service (NESDIS).  The satellite retrieval
     algorithms actually measure the temperature of the ocean using
     several different infrared frequencies to eliminate the
     interference caused by atmospheric water vapor.  These algorithms
     only work in cloud free areas.  Because the algorithms only
     measure a skin temperature (with depths on the order of
     millimeters), the retrivevals are tuned against in situ
     temperatures from drifting buoys.  A discussion of these
     algorithms can be found in:

     McClain, E. P., W. G. Pichel, and C. C. Walton, 1985: Comparative
          performance of AVHRR-based multichannel sea surface
          temperatures. J. Geophys. Res., 90, 11587-11601.

          estimating sea surface temperature with AVHRR satellite
          data.

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     For the data in this archive, the in situ data were obtained from a
     preliminary version of the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set
     (COADS) for the 1980s.  These data consist of logbook and radio reports.
     The satellite data were produced at the University of Miami's Rosenteil
     School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences from analyses of satellite
     retrievals obtained from AVHRR. COADS data procedures are described in:

     Slutz, R. J., S. J. Lubker, J. D. Hiscox, S. D. Woodruff, R. L.

            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

9.1  Formulas.

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.

            The analysis technique consists of preliminary elimination of SST
            data with bad position or bad SST values.  All observations are
            then averaged over onto a 1-degree weekly grid. These "super
            observations" are then used in the analysis.  The analysis
            consists of two steps.  First, the satellite super observations
            are corrected for any large scale (1000 km) biases relative to
            the in situ super observations. Finally, the in situ and corrected
            satellite super observations are processed using optimum
            interpolation to produce an analyzed SST field. A complete
            description of all the data processing and analysis techniques
            may be found in:

                          10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      Errors in the final SST product are caused by errors in the
      data and errors in the analysis method.  Reynolds and Smith
      (1994) determined that the rms errors from different types of
      data were: ship, 1.5C; buoy, 0.8C; day satellite, 0.8C; and night
      satellite, 0.5C.  

      To determine the analysis error, the SSTs from the OI were
      compared with SSTs from three equatorial moored buoys located at
      110W, 140W and 165E.  The SST data from these buoys were not used
      in the analysis. The monthly difference between buoys and the
      analysis were computed for the period 1982-93.  The rms
      errors were: 0.38C at 110W, 0.39C at 140W and 0.24C at 165E. The
      bias errors (buoy - analysis) were -0.21C at 110W; -0.26C at 140W
      and -0.05C at 165E.  The errors are larger in the eastern Pacific
      because of the gradients and variability are larger than in the
      west.  Analysis rms errors less that 0.4C can be expected over
      much of globe except in regions of the western boundary currents
      (e.g., the Gulf Stream) where the rms errors can be 2 to 3 times
      larger.
