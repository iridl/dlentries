                        3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     Sea ice concentrations derived from satellite-based passive microwave 
     observations have been collected continuously since 1978 for a number of 
     scientific programs.  The basic data are archived at the National Snow 
     and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), World Data Center for Glaciology - A.  These 
     data have been used for climate change detection, operational sea ice 
     forecasting, climate modeling, and climate reanalysis.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Sea ice concentration (fraction of grid cell area which is covered
     by sea ice) expressed as a percent.

3.3  Discussion.

     The underlying data set which has been collected are passive microwave
     brightness temperatures.  These data are useful for several scientific
     purposes, especially for estimating sea ice concentration.  The basic
     data are collected on a large swath scanning microwave radiometer, at
     a resolution of approximately 25 km from a polar orbiting satellite.
     The satellite covers the mid-latitudes with about a three day
     repeat time.  High latitude points are passed nearly every day.  

     The brightness temperatures are converted to ice concentrations by
     use of the NASA Team algorithm [Cavalieri, 1992].  The annual average
     accuracy, estimated by comparison with LANDSAT imagery (itself estimated
     to be accurate to about 4%) collocated and at the same time, is 7%, with 
     a bias of -4%.  That is, the passive microwave estimate is biased about 
     4% low.  The errors are greater in summer, but the verification itself is 
     suspect owing to errors which also affect the LANDSAT comparison set 
     [Cavalieri, 1992].

     An ice concentration of 15% typically corresponds to the ice edge.
     Values less than that are normally weather contamination.  A 38%
     concentration corresponds to the main body of the ice pack [Cavalieri, 
     1992].
 
                   4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

This data set consists of global gridded data of monthly sea ice 
concentrations derived from passive microwave radiometry.  In the polar 
regions, the contributions from the atmosphere are low, in the absence of 
storms, for the wavelength span of passive microwave radiometers (0.8 cm to 
4.5 cm).  The contributions from the surface can be expressed as a product of 
the emissivity and the physical temperature of the radiating layer.  This 
linear relationship holds because the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to the 
Planck blackbody law is valid for passive microwave radiometers (SMMR, SSM/I) 
wavelength intervals over the range of physical temperatures encountered on 
the Earth.  Radiances are frequently described in terms of brightness 
temperature.  Depending on the polarized component and the wavelength of the 
radiation, the emissivities of ice-free open water lie in the range 0.28 - 
0.75, and those of sea ice lie in the range 0.52 - 96.  Except at wavelengths 
shorter than 1 cm, there is no overlap in the water versus ice emissivity 
ranges, and sea ice can readily be discerned against the background of open 
ocean. Moreover, sea ice emissivities vary with ice type, allowing some ice 
types to be distinguished, within certain limitations, by multichannel 
microwave observations.  For additional information on Microwave properties of 
sea ice and open ocean see Gloersen et al. (1992).

                          6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     The brightness temperature data are available from the NSIDC on CD-ROM, 
     as are the NASA Team algorithms for processing the brightness 
     temperatures to obtain ice concentrations.  Already mapped ice 
     concentrations are also available from NSIDC, again on CD-ROM.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     The NSIDC data are mapped on a polar stereographic grid with a true 
     latitude of 70 N or S, and resolution of 25 km at that latitude.  The 
     data here have been averaged to a 1 degree regular latitude-longitude 
     grid.

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from North 
            to South and from West to East beginning at 180 degrees West and 
            90 degrees North.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered 
            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage

            January 1987 through December 1988.

     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution

8.5  Related Data Sets.

     The basic ice concentration and brightness temperature data sets are
     available from the NSIDC at the full time and space resolution described
     above.  These data do contain some extraneous apparent ice, so processing
     such as that described in section 9 is necessary prior to use.

9.1  Formulas.

     9.1.1  Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.

            Not applicable.

9.2  Data Processing Sequence.

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            1. Obtain brightness temperature grids and NASA Team algorithm 
               from NSIDC.
            2. Apply NASA Team algorithm to brightness temperatures to obtain 
               estimated ice concentrations.
            3. If SST at time of collection is greater than +1 C, set ice 
               concentration to zero.
            4. Regrid onto a 1 degree latitude longitude grid.

            SST is obtained from the Reynolds 'improved' SST available on this 
            CD-ROM (Reynolds and Smith, 1993).

     9.2.2  Processing Changes.

            The NASA Team algorithm tie points are re-calibrated for each 
            satellite.

9.3  Calculations.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            The NASA Goddard DAAC applied the inverse of it's land/sea mask to 
            the sea ice data.  Land values are 0.

9.4  Graphs and Plots.

     The SMMR ice atlas [Gloersen, et al., 1992] provides color maps of
     monthly averaged ice concentration and growth.

                             10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      The concentration algorithm can falsely report melting ice as being sea 
      surface.  This leads to the underestimation of ice concentration, 
      particularly in summer, mentioned above.  In situations with high winds, 
      waves, or rain, it is possible for the algorithm to report ice as being 
      present when there is in fact none.  The Nomura [1993] quality control 
      described above removes most of this contamination.  

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      The quality of the ice concentration algorithm is assessed in
      Cavalieri [1992].  The Nomura quality control is assessed in 
      Nomura [1993].

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              Quality control applied by the NMC/ECMWF Reanalysis project.   
              At high latitudes, pixels are revisited on approximately a daily 
              basis (poleward of about 70).  At mid latitudes, a given pixel 
              is visited at least once every three days.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              Most of the concerns regarding the accuracy and precision of the 
              ice concentration data apply to use of a single days' 
              concentration map, at full resolution.  After averaging over 
              time to produce a monthly averaged map, the weather 
              contamination problem is largely removed, as few polar areas 
              have persistent heavy rain or winds.  The spatial averaging 
              similarly removes much of the ice edge and melting effects.  The 
              time of greatest error will be in the summer hemisphere ice 
              pack, when extensive melt ponds can be present in the Arctic.  
              (This is less of a problem in the Antarctic as the ice is 
              thinner and doesn't support melt ponds as large or as long as 
              the Arctic's.)

              If an ice-no ice decision is desired, a 50% concentration is 
              recommended for all seasons other than summer, then to lower 
              that cutoff to 45% for the Arctic in summer.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              The annual average accuracy, estimated by comparison with 
              LANDSAT imagery (itself estimated to be accurate to about 4%) 
              collocated and at the same time is 7%, with a bias of -4% 
              [Cavalieri, 1992].  That is, the passive microwave estimate is 
              biased about 4% low.  

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

11.1  Known Problems With The Data.

      None reported at this revision.

11.2  Usage Guidance.

      The concentrations are respectable as concentrations.  Deriving
      features, such as the ice edge, are not recommended as the data 
      have been spatially reduced from the original data set.
