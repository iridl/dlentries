     NOAA Weekly Snow and Ice Cover Charts are produced and digitized by NOAA
     personnel.  Quality control of the data set, including limited 
     adjustments to the files for standardization purposes, has subsequently 
     been conducted at Rutgers University by Dr. David A. Robinson.

                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     To gain a better understanding of the kinematics of Northern Hemisphere
     snow cover.  Snow cover is a sensitive indicator of climate dynamics
     and climate change, and an integrator of basic climate elements.  Due in
     large part to its spatial and temporal impact on surface albedo, snow
     plays a critical role in the earth-atmosphere energy budget, and is the
     dictating factor in a major climatic feedback.  Serial files of this
     critical land surface variable are needed in direct support of climate 
     and global change studies.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Coverage of snow over Northern Hemisphere lands.

3.3  Discussion.

     NOAA began mapping snow cover over Northern Hemisphere lands in 1966, 
     using meteorological satellite images.  The weekly charts resulting from 
     this effort continue to be generated operationally and remain the only 
     such hemispheric product.  They comprise the longest satellite-based 
     environmental record available.

     NOAA charts are based on a visual interpretation of photographic copies 
     of visible satellite imagery by trained meteorologists.  The subpoint 
     resolution of the meteorological satellites used prior to 1972 was about 
     4 km.  The Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) launched in 1972 
     provided imagery with a spatial resolution of 1.0 km.  Since November 
     1978, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has provided 
     1.1-km resolution data.  Imagery is examined daily and charts show snow 
     boundaries on the last day of the chart week that the surface in a region 
     is seen.

     In early years the snow extent was underestimated on the NOAA charts,
     especially during fall.  Charting improved considerably in 1972 with the
     deployment of the VHRR sensor and the increased experience among 
     analysts in recognizing snow-covered ground.  Since then the charts are 
     considered suitable for continental-scale climate studies.

     The NOAA charts are digitized weekly using the National Meteorological 
     Center's primitive equation grid.  This is an 89 X 89 cell Northern 
     Hemisphere grid having a polar sterographic projection.  The version of 
     this data set which is archived at Rutgers University is adjusted to a 
     standard land mask.  The Rutgers data set has been converted to a 1 X 1 
     degree equal angle grid, by Dr. David Robinson at Rutgers University, for 
     use on the ISLSCP Initiative 1 CD-ROM.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

Continental coverage of snow extent can be provided from analyses of visible 
environmental satellite imagery at a relatively high spatial resolution (one 
to several kilometers).  Snow is identified by recognizing characteristic 
textured surface features and brightnesses of snow covered land.  Information 
on surface albedo and percent snow cover (patchiness) is also gleaned from the 
data.  Temporal resolution of coverage is potentially as often as every 
several hours when a polar-orbiting environmental satellite passes over a 
region, or in the middle and lower high latitudes as frequent as an hourly 
basis from geostationary satellite.  Clouds and darkness are the major 
obstacles in obtaining data on a timely basis.

                            5.  EQUIPMENT

5.1  Instrument Description.

     The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is a cross-track 
     scanning system featuring two visible, one middle infrared, and two 
     thermal channels.

     5.1.1  Platform.

            NOAA-9, NOAA-10, and NOAA-11 polar orbiting platforms, for the 
            period 1987 and 1988.

     5.1.2  Mission Objectives.

            The AVHRR is designed for multispectral analysis of meteorol-
            ogic, oceanographic, and hydrologic parameters. The objective of
            the instrument is to provide radiance data for investigation of
            clouds, land-water boundaries, snow and ice extent, ice or snow
            melt inception, day and night cloud distribution, temperatures
            of radiating surfaces, and sea surface temperature. It is an
            integral member of the payload on the advanced TIROS-N space-
            craft and its successors in the NOAA series, and as such contri-
            butes data required to meet a number of operational and research-
            oriented meteorological objectives.

     5.1.3  Key Variables.

            Emitted radiation, reflected radiation.

     5.1.4  Principles of Operation.

            The AVHRR is a four-channel or five-channel scanning radio-
            meter which detects emitted and reflected radiation from the
            Earth in the visible, near-infrared and far-infrared regions of
            the spectrum. A fifth channel has been added to the follow-on
            instrument designated AVHRR/2 and flown on NOAA-7, NOAA-9,
            NOAA-11 (and subsequent odd-numbered missions) to improve the
            correction for atmospheric vapor. Scanning is provided by an
            elliptical beryllium mirror rotating at 360 rpm about an axis
            parallel to the Earth. A two-stage radiant cooler is used to
            maintain a constant temperature for the IR detectors of 95
            degrees K. The operating temperature is selectable at either 105
            or 110 degrees K. The telescope is an 8-inch afocal, all-
            reflective Cassegrain system. Polarization is less than 10
            percent. Instrument operation is controlled by 26 commands and
            monitored by 20 analog housekeeping parameters.

     5.1.5  Instrument Measurement Geometry.

            The AVHRR is a cross-track scanning system. The instan-
            taneous field-of-view (IFOV)  of each sensor is approximately 1.4
            milliradians giving a resolution of 1.1 km at the satellite
            subpoint. There is about a 36 percent overlap between IFOVs
            (1.362 samples per IFOV). The scanning rate of the AVHRR is six
            scans per second, and each scan spans an angle of +/- 55.4
            degrees from the nadir.

5.2  Calibration.

     The Thermal infrared channels are calibrated in-flight using a view of
     a stable blackbody and space as a reference. No in-flight visible
     channel calibration is performed.

                          6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     NOAA charts are based on a visual interpretation of photographic copies 
     of visible imagery by trained meteorologists.  The subpoint resolution of 
     the meteorological satellites used prior to 1972 was about 4 km.  The 
     Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) launched in 1972 provided imagery 
     with a spatial resolution of 1.0 km.  Since November 1978, the Advanced 
     Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR has provided 1.1-km resolution 
     data.  Imagery is examined daily and charts show snow boundaries on the 
     last day of the chart week that the surface in a region is seen.  These 
     charts are subsequently digitized weekly using the National 
     Meteorological Center's primitive equation grid.  This is an 89 x 89 cell 
     northern hemisphere grid having a polar stereographic projection.  Cell 
     resolution ranges from 16,000 to 42,000 square kilometers.  Only cells 
     interpreted to be at least 50% snow covered are considered snow covered.

     The Snow Cover data on the ISLSCP Initiative 1 CD-ROM was converted from 
     the 89 x 89 polar stereographic projection to a 1 x 1 degree equal angle 
     grid (see section 9.3.1 for details), by Dr. David Robinson at the 
     Department of Geography, Rutgers University. This data set has also been 
     adjusted to a standard land mask (see section 9.2.1).

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The NOAA/NESDIS Snow Cover data only covers land in the Northern 
            Hemisphere.  Data in file are ordered from North to South and from 
            West to East beginning at 180 degrees West and 90 degrees North.  
            Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered at 89.5 N and 179.5 
            W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            Charts have been produced from 1966 to present.  In early years 
            the snow extent was underestimated on the NOAA charts, especially
            during fall.  This was a result of the meteorological satellites 
            having a 4 km resolution during this period.  Charting improved 
            considerably in 1972 with the deployment of the VHRR sensor and 
            the increased experience among analysts in recognizing snow-
            covered ground.

            The snow cover data on the ISLSCP CD-ROM covers the period from 
            December 29, 1986 to January 1, 1989.

            The number of days in a year (365 1/4) is not exactly divisible by 
            7; consequently, the dates for each weekly chart vary from year to 
            year, and a 53rd week occurs approximately every five years.  
            Below is a listing of the week number along with their 
            corresponding dates for 1987 and 1988:

        1987                                1988

     9.2.1  Processing Steps and Data Sets.

            The NOAA charts are digitized weekly using the National
            Meteorological Center's primitive equation grid.  This is an 89 x
            89 cell northern hemisphere grid having a polar sterographic
            projection.  Only cells interpreted to be at least 50% snow 
            covered are considered snow covered.  The preceding efforts are 
            conducted by NOAA personnel. The version of this data set which is 
            archived at Rutgers University is adjusted to a standard land 
            mask.  NOAA has not treated 53 cells (covering 1.8 million square 
            kilometers) consistently over the charting history.  In 1981 NOAA 
            changed their land mask; 26 land cells were reclassified as water 
            and 27 new land cells were added.  Neither of the NOAA masks is 
            accurate; both fail to accurately identify all land (greater than 
            50% land) and water cells.  An accurate land mask was developed at 
            Rutgers using digital map files analyzed on a geographic 
            information system. The percentage of land in each of the 7921 
            National Meteorological Center grid cells was calculated using the 
            National Geophysical Data Center's 5-minute resolution ETOPO5 file 
            as the primary data source.  As this file does not include large 
            interior lakes, the Navy Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center's 10-
            min resolution Primary Terrain Cover Types file was used to 
            account for these water bodies.  Some 48 cells poleward of 
            approximately 30 degrees N, which had been considered land in the 
            pre-1981 NOAA or in the 1981-to-present NOAA mask, are actually 
            predominantly water covered.  Conversely, 54 land cells were 
            considered water on one or both NOAA masks, and these required a 
            first-time analysis to determine whether they might be snow 
            covered.  This was accomplished by selecting nearest 
            representative land cells (cells that NOAA has continually charted 
            as land) and assigning their snow status to the "new" land cells.  
            Spot checks of a number of hard copy weekly charts prove this to 
            be an adequate approach.  The product on this CD-ROM is grided to 
            the common land/sea mask used for all other data sets on the 
            CD-ROMs.

     9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments.

            The Dept. of Geography (Dr. David Robinson) at Rutgers University 
            converted the original 89 x 89 polar sterographic projection grid 
            data to a 1 x 1 degree equal angle grid with an origin point of 90 
            latitude and -180 longitude.  Their procedure was to create vector 
            boxes for each grid cell in the original 89 x 89 cell NOAA matrix 
            (the one laid over a polar stereo projection for digitization 
            purposes).  The next step was to create a raster file, with each 
            raster cell having 1 x 1 degree dimensions.  This was "laid" over 
            the vector file, and the raster cell is assigned the value of the 
            vector box in which the raster cell's center point lies.  Thus 
            there is no weighted averaging should a raster cell sit over more 
            than one vector cell.

                          10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error.

      Snow cover is most difficult to identify (if at all possible) where 1)
      skies are frequently cloudy, 2) solar zenith angles are relatively high
      and illumination is low (or absent), 3) the snow cover is unstable or
      changes rapidly, and 4) pronounced local and regional signatures, such 
      as the distribution of vegetation, lakes and rivers, are absent.

10.2  Quality Assessment.

      10.2.1  Data Validation by Source.

              Efforts to validate the data have included comparisons with
              satellite and station data.  These have primarily been done on a
              regional basis for selected intervals.  They include comparing
              snow boundaries on NOAA charts to boundaries derived from
              independent analyses of hard-copy visible satellite imagery
              conducted in a manner similar to that of NOAA personnel.
              Regional NOAA snow boundaries have also been compared with
              boundaries derived from analyses of dense networks of stations.
              Finally, preliminary comparisons of continental snow areas
              calculated from NOAA data have been compared with areas
              calculated from satellite microwave-derived snow cover charts.

              Sensing Symposium Digest, WA-1, 2.1-2.9.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              In general, the NOAA charts, while less than perfect, are
              considered to be the most accurate means of obtaining snow 
              extent information on large regional to hemispheric scales.

              Some of the shortcomings in using shortwave data to chart snow 
              cover include:

              1) the inability to detect snow cover when solar illumination is 
                 low or when skies are cloudy,

              2) the underestimation of cover where dense forests mask the 
                 underlying snow,

              3) difficulties in discriminating snow from clouds in 
                 mountainous regions and in uniform lightly-vegetated areas 
                 that have a high surface brightness when snow covered,

              4) the lack of all but the most general information on snow 
                 depth (Kukla and Robinson, 1981; Dewey and Heim, 1982).

              Despite the shortwave limitations, the NOAA charts are quite 
              reliable at many times and in many regions. These include 
              regions where:

              1) skies are frequently clear, commonly in Spring near the snow 
                 line,

              2) solar zenith angles are relatively low and illumination is 
                 high,

              3) the snow cover is reasonable stable or changes slowly,

              4) pronounced local and regional signatures are present owing to 
                 the distribution of vegetation, lakes and rivers. 

              Under these conditions, the satellite-derived product will be 
              superior to charts of snow extent gleaned from station data, 
              particularly in mountainous and sparsely inhabited regions. 
              Another advantage of the NOAA snow charts is their portrayal of 
              regionally-representative snow extent, whereas charts based on 
              ground station reports may be biased due to the preferred 
              position of weather stations in valleys and in places affected 
              by urban heat islands, such as airports.

      10.2.3  Measurement Error for Parameters and Variables.

              No quantitative error estimates have been done on more than a
              regional level over selected time intervals.

      10.2.4  Additional Quality Assessment Applied.

              Efforts to validate the NOAA charts have been infrequent and on 
              regional levels.

                             11.  NOTES

11.1  Known Problems With The Data.
