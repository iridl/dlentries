                            3.  INTRODUCTION

3.1  Objective/Purpose.

     Create a global mid-monthly mean snow depth climatology with highest 
     resolution possible using all available station data for the months of
     September through June.

3.2  Summary of Parameters.

     Mean mid-monthly snow depths measured in inches.

3.3  Discussion.

     Following an extensive literature search, snow depth data were obtained 
     from as many sources as possible, worldwide.  A full bibliography of the 
     data sources is contained in the document USAF/ETAC/TN-88/006 Global Snow 
     Depth Climatology and in section 10.2.2, 12.1 and 12.2 of this document.  
     Each data source is rated according to a high, fair, or low confidence 
     level.  Data from the numerous sources were plotted on hemispheric maps 
     by month and the maps were manually analyzed.  Data were gridded to an 
     "eighth mesh" reference grid.  This grid divides the hemispheres into 64 
     equal boxes and each box is divided into 4,096 grid points that are 25 
     nautical miles (46 km) apart.  More information on the eighth grid can be 
     found in Hoke et al., 1979.  A mid-month-snow depth value to the nearest 
     whole inch was assigned to each box.  Each grid value was compared from 
     month to month to insure temporal consistency of the data.  The complete 
     grid was then digitized.  In certain data sparse areas such as 
     Antarctica, Greenland, China, and various mountain areas, special 
     methodologies were developed to provide mean snow depths.  These methods 
     are described in the Foster and Davy, 1988.  The data were regridded and 
     converted to metric units at the GSFC DAAC.

                        4.  THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS

The snow depth values represent measurement derived from a variety of methods.  
For more information on the measurements see the documents referenced in 
section 10.2.2, 12.1 and 12.2 below.  The data were analyzed by hand to an 8th 
mesh grid.  Note that these data relate to snowpack depth not Snow Water 
Equivalent (SWE).

                          6.  PROCEDURE

6.1  Data Acquisition Methods.

     Following an extensive literature search, snow depth data were obtained 
     from as many sources as possible, worldwide.  Data from the numerous 
     sources were plotted on hemispheric maps by month and the maps were 
     manually analyzed.  Data were gridded to an "eighth mesh" reference grid 
     (approx. 46 km).  A mid-month snow depth value to the nearest whole inch 
     was assigned to each box.  Each grid value was compared from month to 
     month to insure temporal consistency of the data.  The complete grid was 
     then digitized.

6.2  Spatial Characteristics.

     Spatial resolution of the input data (station measurements) is highly 
     variable.  Spatial resolution of the manually interpolated output data is 
     "eighth mesh" or approximately 46.3 km.  The Goddard DAAC converted the 
     data from the 46.3 km polar projection to an equal-angle grid described 
     below. See section 9.3.1 for the regridding procedure.

     6.2.1  Spatial Coverage.

            The coverage is global.  Data in each file are ordered from north 
            to south and from west to east beginning at 180 degrees west and 
            90 degrees north.  Point (1,1) represents the grid cell centered 
            at 89.5 N and 179.5 W (see section 8.4).

     6.2.2  Spatial Resolution.

            The data are given in an equal-angle lat/long grid that has a 
            spatial resolution of 1 X 1 degree lat/long.

6.3  Temporal Characteristics.

     6.3.1  Temporal Coverage.

            This is a climatolgy data set, therefore it is not year specific.

     6.3.2  Temporal Resolution.

            Climatology represents an average snow depth value for mid-month.

            The original data were in an 8th mesh grid.  An 8th mesh grid can 
            be visualized as a global hemisphere overlayed by an 8 x 8 grid, 
            for a total of 64 grid boxes.  Within each box, there are 64 x 64 
            points, totaling 4096 points of data values, approximately 46.3 km 
            apart.  The Goddard DAAC utilized a routine developed by USAF 
            Ice/Snow group to assign a latitude and longitude to each of the 
            4096 points within each of the 64 boxes.  These snow depth values 
            and their corresponding latitude and longitude were used to assign 
            each value to a 1 x 1 degree grid cell, maintaining a summation 
            and counter for any data values that fall within a grid cell.  
            Average snow depth values were then calculated for each grid cell.  
            The resulting 1 x 1 degree hemispheric grid of snow depth values 
            was then concatenated with the corresponding hemisphere of gridded 
            values for each month.  

            For latitudes higher than 65 deg. N and 65 deg. S, raw data 
            resolution exceeding the target resolution, resulting in empty 
            grids where data coverage should be continuous.  The Goddard DAAC 
            used the spline technique for unequally spaced intervals to 
            interpolate the missing snow depth values.  The software used to 
            perform this interpolation was provided by Dr. L. Bounoua 
            (NASA/GSFC, Code 923 (301 286-1406)).  


            The ISLSCP land/sea mask on this CD-ROM (LAND_SEA.MSK) was applied 
            to this data.

9.4  Graphs and Plots.

     Contour plots of mean mid-monthly snow depths for September through June 
     for the Northern Hemisphere in the original 8th mesh grid format are 
     provided in Foster & Davey, 1988.

      10.2.2  Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.

              The confidence in sources for the USAF/ETAC Snow Depth data 
              varies by geographic location. Below is a comprehensive list of 
              regional sources. A confidence factor is included for each 
              region, which indicates the degree of confidence that can be 
              placed in the data produced for that region. The confidence 
              factors are explained as follows:

              High Confidence: Summarized snow depth values were available, 
              and there were more than 5 years period of record.

              Fair Confidence: Summarized snow depth values were limited; 
              discussion material was insufficient to produce a high degree of 
              confidence.

              Low Confidence: Summarized snow depth values were not available, 
              and there was only limited discussion material.

              AFRICA--High Confidence. Research suggested that snow cover was 
              not present long enough here (except on the mountain peaks) to 
              maintain a mean monthly snow depth or attempt inclusion in this 
              study.

              ALBANIA--High Confidence. Research suggested that snow cover was 
              not present long enough here (except on the higher mountain 
              peaks) to maintain a mean monthly snow depth or attempt 
              inclusion in this study.

              ANTARCTICA--Low Confidence. Snow depth was calculated in 
              Antarctica by dividing mean annual water equivalent by snow 
              density. Antarctic snow densities were acquired from a 
              literature search of sources.

              the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). These journals 
              contained maximum monthly snow depths for 200 Chinese stations. 
              After summarizing this data, a subjective value of 80 percent of 
              the total depth was used to estimate the mean.

11.1  Known Problems With The Data.

      Quality of the climatology is regional and decreases with the decreasing 
      spatial density of the surface reporting stations contributing to the 
      climatology.  The time periods covered by the input data sets are not 
      consistent, varying across the globe.
