The data are <a

<p> For those that would prefer a CD-ROM to downloading or manipulating
on-line,

<p>The goals of the <a
href="http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/erbe/ASDerbe.html">Earth
  Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)</a> are:
<ol>
  <li>to understand the radiation balance between the Sun, Earth, atmosphere,
    and space which drives our weather and climate system and</li>
  <li>to establish an accurate, long-term baseline dataset for studying
climate
    changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) data are fundamental to the development of
realistic
  climate models and for studying natural and anthropogenic perturbations
of the
  climate system. (<b>ReadMeFileIntro</b>)</p>
<p>The NASA (ERBE) dataset contains data collected simultaneously by identical
  ERB instruments on three satellites: the NASA Earth Radiation Budget
Satellite
  (ERBS), launched in October 1984, and two National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration
  (NOAA) Sun-synchronous operational satellites, NOAA-9 and NOAA-10, launched
  in December 1984 and November 1986, respectively. The ERBE satellites
have provided
  the most comprehensive and best resolved ERB measurements ever obtained
(<b>ReadMeFileIntro</b>).
  Data for combined satellite cases are also presented here. These data [on
CD-ROM]
  were obtained from the <a href="http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/">NASA
Langley Research
  Center EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Center</a>. The CD-ROM is formatted
  in the ISO-9660 standard. Monthly average values, for the time periods
during
  which the scanning radiometers were operational, are also included:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ERBS - November 1984 through February 1990<br>
    NOAA-9 - February 1985 through January 1986<br>
    NOAA-10 - November 1986 through May 1989</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The ERBE scanner instrument package contains three instruments used to
measure
  shortwave (0.2 to 5 microns), longwave (5 to 50 microns), and total waveband
  radiation (0.2 to 200 microns). Each detector scans the Earth from
horizon to
  horizon. The scanners usually operated in a cross track mode; However, ERBS
  scanned in an along track mode during January 1985 and August 1985, and
at an
  azimuth of 145&#176; during hot orbit periods from December 1985 through
  February 1990. NOAA-9 operated along track during August of 1985. The
NOZZ-10
  scanner operated at an azimuth of 35&#176; from January through mid-May
  and from mid-August through December of each year. (Weaver et al. 1991
and 1992,
