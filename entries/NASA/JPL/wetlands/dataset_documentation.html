<h2>Inundated wetland areas</h2>
<p>Spaceborne microwave remote sensing offers effective tools for characterizing wetlands since it is particularly sensitive to surface water and to vegetation structure, and it allows monitoring large inaccessible areas on a temporal basis regardless of atmospheric conditions or solar illumination. Through the use of remote sensing instruments, wetlands can be periodically mapped and examined.
