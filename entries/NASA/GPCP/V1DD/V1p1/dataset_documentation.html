Experimental GPCP 1-Degree Daily Combination</h2></center>
<p>
The data can found <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.GPCP/.V1DD/">here</a>.

The following documentation is from the <a href="http://precip.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA Global Precipitation Analyss website</a>.

This data set is a companion to the <a href="http://precip.gsfc.nasa.gov/gpcp_v2_comb.html">GPCP Version
2 Combination</a> (which the reader should see for descriptions,including
references). <font size=+0>Many users need precipitation estimates at finer
space and time scales than the operational data set provides. Starting
in October 1996 the GPCP began producing 3-hourly merged global infrared
(IR) brightness temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) histograms on a 1&deg;x1&deg;
grid in the band 40&deg;N-40&deg;S, and this collection has prompted this
new global One-Degree Daily (1DD) product.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In this first official release, the 1DD uses the "best"
quasi-global observational estimators of underlying statistics to adjust
quasi-global observational datasets that have desirable time/space coverage.
Specifically,</font>
<dir><font size=+0>* Special Sensor/Microwave Imager (SSM/I; 0.5&deg;x0.5&deg;
by orbit, GPROF6.0 algorithm) provides fractional occurrence, and</font>
<p><font size=+0>* GPCP Version 2 Satellite-Gauge (SG) combination (2.5&deg;x2.5&deg;
monthly) provides monthly accumulation</font>
<p><font size=+0>to algorithms working on</font>
<p><font size=+0>* geosynchronous-orbit IR (geo-IR) T<sub>b</sub> histograms
(as above),</font>
<p><font size=+0>* low-orbit IR (leo-IR) GOES Precipitation Index (GPI;
same time/space grid as geo-IR), and</font>
<p><font size=+0>* TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS; 1&deg;x1&deg;
on daily nodes, Susskind algorithm).</font></dir>
<font size=+0>Even though microwave precipitation estimates and gauge analyses
do not explicitly appear in this list due to sampling limitations, the
calibration to the Version 2 SG ensures that they do have a strong influence
on the overall scaling. The differences between the IR and TOVS datasets
required that the 1DD be formulated in two parts, with smoothing from 40&deg;
to 50&deg; in each hemisphere to patch the data boundary.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In the band 40&deg;N-S the Threshold-Matched Precipitation
Index (TMPI) produces approximate instantaneous precipitation from the
geo-IR T<sub>b</sub> with fill-in by rescaled leo-IR GPI. It is a GPI-type
algorithm with locally calibrated T<sub>b</sub> threshold and rainrate.
To do this, time/space-matched geo-IR T<sub>b</sub> and GPROF fractional
coverage data are used to set the T<sub>b</sub> threshold such that instantaneous
geo-IR fractional coverage equals GPROF's. Then a single rainrate for "raining"
geo-IR pixels is computed for each grid box that makes the full month of
TMPI sum to the local SG (monthly) value. Mismatches in geo-IR and GPROF
precipitation cause some unrealistic TMPI conditional rain rates, so an
"auditing" technique was developed to fill in reasonable values and re-estimate
the geo-IR threshold. A less tractable problem is that the warmest geo-IR
histogram bin starts at T<sub>b</sub>=270K, which prevents correctly setting
the threshold in regions with only warm-top clouds.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The leo-IR GPI data tend to exhibit a very high number
of rain days. To overcome this, the local number of leo-IR GPI rain days
was reduced by the ratio of the total number of GPROF6.0 and leo-IR GPI
rain days. The remaining non-zero daily rain amounts are rescaled to start
at zero and sum over the month to the (local) SG value.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Similarly, the original TOVS dataset tends to exhibit
a very high number of rain days. To overcome this, in each hemisphere the
local number of TOVS rain days was reduced by the ratio of the total number
of TMPI and TOVS rain days at 40&deg;. The remaining non-zero daily rain
amounts are rescaled to start at zero and sum over the month to the (local)
SG value.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The 1DD has been computed for 1997-1999, and the instantaneous
TMPI show good consistency between hours and with the daily TMPI, GPI,
and rescaled TOVS fields. The daily 1DD correctly sum to the monthly SG,
except in the subtropical highs where geo-IR threshold saturation becomes
a problem. Even before smoothing, there is good continuity across the 40&deg;
N and S data boundary, perhaps in part because the IR and TOVS datasets
both largely represent clouds. This dependence on scaled cloud information
implies that users should expect large error bars on the individual daily
values, and preliminary validation results support this view. Space and/or
time averages should be more reliable.</font>
<p><font size=+0>It is expected that the 1DD will see extensive development
work. This might include: diurnally varying calibrations; extension back
in time, even if at lower quality; additional sensors, including daily
gauges and Microwave Sounding Unit; direct use of microwave estimates;
and refined combination approaches.</font>
<p>The current data set extends from January 1997--December 1999, and subsequently
it will be extended from 1997--present (with some delay to allow the scaling
to the monthly GPCP Version 2 Combination SG). The primary product in the
1DD dataset is a combined observation-only dataset. That is, a gridded
analysis based on satellite estimates of rainfall is constrained by a monthly
analysis that is based on gauge and satellite observations. The initial
product suite includes the "final" estimates of precipitation.
<p>The data set archive consists of unformatted REAL*4 binary month files
that contain 1 row (1440 B) of header and then all the days of the month,
stacked sequentially.&nbsp; Missing days (if any) are filled with the missing
flag -99999. These files are gzip'ed. Each gzip'ed file occupies about
3.5 MB, and the whole data set contains about 126 MB. The grid on which
each field of values is presented is a 1<font size=+0>&deg;</font>x1<font size=+0>&deg;</font>
latitude--longitude (Cylindrical Equal Distance) global array of points.
It is size 360x180, with X (longitude) incrementing most rapidly West to
East from the Prime Meridian, and then Y (latitude) incrementing North
to South. Whole- and half-degree values are at grid edges:
<br>First point center = (89.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>N,0.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>E)
<br>Second point center = (89.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>N,1.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>E)
<br>Last point center = (89.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>S,0.5<font size=+0>&deg;</font>W)
<br>Missing values are denoted by the value -99999., and the units are
mm/day.
