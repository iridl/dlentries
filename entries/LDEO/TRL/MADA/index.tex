Hi Jennie, Benno,

This all looks fine; however, Ed and I have been discussing whether to make the entire period available at this time -- the paper only analyzes the period since A.D. 1300 -- the data rich period -- we'd like to make only that portion (A.D. 1300 through the end) available via IRI/LDEO -- can this be done?

There reference for the Science paper will be close to:

Cook, E.R., K.J. Anchukaitis, B.M. Buckley, R.D. D'Arrigo, G.C. Jacoby, W.E. Wright, Asian monsoon failure and megadrought during the last millennium, Science, 328(5977), doi:10.1126/science.1185188, 2010

thanks
cheers
kevin
