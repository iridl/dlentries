<h1>North Western South America Retrospective Simulation from CMC - OA - INAMHI</h1>
<p>
This dataset corresponds to 30 km resolution and 6 hr WRFv2.2 output. It has been forced using <a href="http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds090.0/">NNRP</a>. It is not bias-corrected. The configuration for the physic parameterization includes Kessler scheme for microphysics and RRTM and Dudhia schemes for longwave and shortwave radiation, respectively. It has also been configured using the Monin-Obukhov (Janjic) scheme for surface-layer, and thermal difussion with 5 soil levels for land-surface physics. The Mellor-Yamada-Janjic TKE scheme was employed for the boundary-layer option, and the SST update option was selected.
