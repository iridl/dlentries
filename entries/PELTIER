Data resolution:	1 degree latitude/longitude grid
	data starting at (-179.5,+89.5) 
	180 rows of (360 points along a line of constant latitude).

Time Period: 21KBP to the present

Data 1:	topographical heights at 1 Kyr intervals since the last glacial
	maximum.

Units:	metres. However in order to present a dataset in positive
	integer format, 10000 has been added.
	i.e if the data in this dataset is called itopog
	    then
		true_topog = itopog - 10000
	true_topog has values within the range [-9300,7200] metres.

Data 2:	Ice-cover data at 1 Kyr intervals since the last glacial maximum.

Values: 1 if there is ice, 0 otherwise.


Files: Either	tar files TOP.tar and ICE.tar
       Or	top.n     for n=0,1,...,21 and
		is_ice.n  for n=0,1,...,21

      OR   asciispecial format files   ice0.asc   through    ice21.asc,
        located in directory /asciispecial.  Asciispecial files are
        text files suitable for import to plotting programs such as
         Spyglass.   The format includes text headers, a listing of 
         lat-long grid values, and the data points.

       There is also an ascii version of top.21 called TOP.21.ascii,
       which can be used to check interpretation of the binary files.

	The tar files were created on an SGI machine, you may need to
	use dd to swap bytes on other machines (eg Suns):
	  dd if=TOP.tar conv=swab | tar xvof -


Logical Data Structure: 16 bit binary unsigned integers,
			least significant byte first.


Note:	In some areas, the ice-cover data indicates that there is ice
	while the topographic height is negative indicating that the
	region is below sealevel. In these cases, it should be assumed
	that the area is ice-covered. Either the region is not inundated
	or the ice is floating.
