Notes on SMIP-2

Need to know where to put this (what does SMIP belong to?) WCRP DONE

Some latitude grids don't have the right North/south edge

Still need to cache data off mass-store for decent performance.

Documentation of models, project, Anything.

/beluga/data/benno/mydata/SMIP-2/forecast_SST/RPN/index.tex
edit ** out of title
edit units out of title
add long_name from title  (should not be using title for long_name or standard_name)

units of lev on level

changed title of tas to Surface Air Temperature

/beluga/data/benno/mydata/SMIP-2/forecast_SST/KMA/index.tex
note the 2.5 month starting lag -- I did this because MAM is the earliest time
in the 1979 directory, i.e. JFM and FMA are 1980 times even though they are in
the 1979 directory.

Had to edit the units and edit them out of the title
Had to add long_name as copy of title

level has units of lev -- what does that mean???
