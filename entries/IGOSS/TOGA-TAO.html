<h1>TOGA-TAO Quarterly SST and winds</h1>
Wind vectors and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the TOGA-TAO
    array of current meter moorings and ATLAS thermistor chain
    moorings.  Both quarterly means and quarterly anomalies are given.
<p>
The data are <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IGOSS/.TOGA-TAO.cdf/">here</a>.
<p>
<h2>Anomalies</h2>
    The anomalies are calculated from the
    COADS wind climatology and the <a
      href="reynoldsclimo.html">Reynolds and Smith 1994 AOI SST</a> climatology.
<p>
First, an anomaly field is computed on the array
grid by subtracting climatological averages from 
the quarterly means after bilinearly interpolating
the climatology field in latitude and longitude 
to the array grid. 

Second, the anomalies are linearly interpolated, 
first in latitude, and then in longitude, to a 1 
deg by 1 deg grid. 

Third, the interpolated anomaly field is smoothed
by passing a gappy running mean filter over the 
data twice, which approximates a Hanning filter by
a triangle, first in the zonal direction, and then
in the meridional direction. Triangle filter widths
are 21 deg in the zonal direction, and 5 deg in the
meridional direction.
<p>
Finally, this gridded and smoothed anomaly field 
is added to the climatology to produce the gridded
quarterly mean field, after bilinearly interpolating
the original climatology to the 1 deg by 1 deg 
grid. 
<p>
This gridding method was developed by Dr. William S. Kessler, 
Dr. Michael J. McPhaden, and Dai McClurg, all at PMEL/NOAA.

<h2>TOGA-TAO Array Support</h2>
The TOGA-TAO array is presently supported by the United States (NOAA
    office of Global Programs, EPOCS), France (ORSTOM), Japan (STA),
    Korea (STA), and Taiwan (NSC).  Further information is available
    from Michael J. McPhaden (NOAA/PMEL).
