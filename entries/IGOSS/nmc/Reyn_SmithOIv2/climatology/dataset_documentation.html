<h3>Description of the OI.v2 Monthly SST 1971-2000 Climatology</h3>
<p>
A new sea surface temperature (SST) climatology for the 1971-2000 base
period was constructed using the method of Reynolds and Smith (1995).
The new climatology was built from two intermediate climatologies:
a 2 degree SST climatology developed from in situ data for the 
period 1971-2000, and a 1 degree SST climatology for the period 
1982-2000 derived from the second version optimum interpolation (OI.v2) SST
analysis.  The OI.v2 is a major improvement over the
original OI analysis (OI.v1) at high latitudes due to a new ice algorithm
(Reynolds et. al. 2001).  The OI.v2 was put into
operation at the Climate Prediction Center in August 2001.
<p>
The changes in the climatology are caused by the changes in the base
period as well as the changes in the OI analysis. The figures at
<a href="http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/predictions/30day/SSTs/sst_clim.html">http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/predictions/30day/SSTs/sst_clim.html</a> 
show the new SST climatology (column 1), the changes of climatology
due to the changes in the base period (column 2), and the changes of climatology
due to the changes in the OI analysis (column 3). In the tropics and subtropics,
the changes in the climatology are largely due to the changes in the
base period, and are generally small with absolute differences usually
less than 0.2°C (column 2 and column 3).  However, in high latitudes
the changes in climatology are due to the changes in the OI analysis
alone. This is because there are insufficient in situ observations in
high latitudes prior to 1982, and the climatology is based on the OI
analysis alone (1982-2000). It is seen that the changes of climatology
due to the changes in the OI analysis often exceed 1°C (third column).
