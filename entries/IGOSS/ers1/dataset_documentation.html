    <h1>ERS-1 Blended Sea Level Anomaly</h1>

Empirical orthogonal functions are used to analyze a set of error maps
    constructed from the difference between monthly mean ERS-1
    altimeter and tide gauge measurements at 30 island locations in
    the central and western Pacific.  The large-scale, low-frequency
    components indentified by this analysis are interpolated and then
    added to the original altimeter data to produce a set of blended
    island/alitmeter sea level maps which are more accurate and
    detailed than those produced from either data set alone.  For more
    information, see Miller et al. Blending ERS-1 Altimetry and
    Tide-Gauge Data, <i>Eos Trans. AGU 74</i>, 16, 1993.<p>
