<h1 align=center>Jones' Surface Temperature  Anomaly Dataset</h1> 

<p>
The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.JONES/">
here </a>.  I picked them up on the NCAR ftp site and rewrote it to
the stunningly effective (shrinking  45MB of original
"anomalies_landonly" ASCII
file into a 3MB file, achieving meanwhile direct-access capacity)  
<a
href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/~senya/docs/cuf.html"
>
CUF format</a> by Senya Basin.  Since the NCAR documentation was not
terribly clear (and with obvious mistakes sometimes), I well could
mess it up somewhere along the way (although I doubt it!).
Anyways, if something looks suspicious, send me an email, or check out
yourself the original <a
href="http://www.scd.ucar.edu/dss/datasets/ds215.0.html"
>
NCAR source directory</a>.

<p><b>Note:</b> There two datasets of climatology (by NCAR
and by Jones) in the same NCAR directory.  I put only <a
	  href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.JONES/.clim.cuf"> Jones'
	climatology </a>  here.


<p> Below I dump all relevant documentation I could find on the NCAR ftp
site.

Dear Dennis,

   Below is Phil Jones' reponse regarding the climatology
for the gridded temperature anomaly dataset. Apparently, he has now
constructed the climatology! I would be happy to send you folks the
data, or if you prefer I'm sure you could get it from him directly.

Regards,

Mike M.

               ON NCAR CLIMATOLOGY (NOT PROVIDED HERE)

                                                Roy Jenne/Will Spangler
                                                March 1994

The climate grids were put together from the southern (ds200.0) and northern
(ds205.0) climatologies here at NCAR.

The anomalies are not anomalies from a climatology grid. They are anomalies
from a period mean, station by station. Although, Jones tries to pick a base
period, it was just not available for each station, so what was available
was used. Then, the grid of anomalies was analyzed with area-weighting and
smoothing.

If one wants a grid of temperatures rather than anomalies, we tell users to
just add our climate grid. Keep in mind that Jones' anomalies are air temp-
eratures over land and sea surface temperatures over water, so the resulting
grid of temperatures is not air temperatures the world over. They will be
close in many areas, but where cold currents they will be off, etc.

Sea surface temperatures were apparently chosen for the advantages of con-
sistency and continuity, and to avoid inherent problems in ship reports.

Also, be aware that if you are using the latest anomaly grids, they 2.5
degrees off in spacing from the climate grids.

We do have hardcopy documentation about the hemispheric climatology grids, but
we really do not have any more documentation than this about the anomalies.
If you want more detail, you may try to contact Phil Jones,

                   F028@CPCMA.EAST-ANGLIA.AC.UK
