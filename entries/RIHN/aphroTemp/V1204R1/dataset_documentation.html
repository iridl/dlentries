This suite of temperature products (version: V1204R1) are constructed by 
the Asian
Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards
Evaluation of the Water Resources (APHRODITE's water resources) project
in collaboration of Research Institute for Humanity and Nature and
Meteorological Research Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency.
The product is 0.5x0.5 and 0.25x0.25 degree gridded data over 
Monsoon Asia. The gridded precipitation is derived
from original rain-gauge data, precompiled datasets, and global 
telecommunication system reports.
In addition to precipitation product, daily temperature product 
are released on June 2012. Our new temperature product (AphroTemp_V1204R1) is 
developed by the APHRODITE project utilizing the collection of observed 
temperature data.
