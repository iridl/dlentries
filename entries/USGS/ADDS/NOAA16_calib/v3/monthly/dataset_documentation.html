<h3>Description of monthly composited and reprojected NDVI data for Africa
 </h3>
<p>
Documentation on dekadal NDVI composites for Africa can be found on the following page from the USGS Africa Data Dissemination Service: <a href="http://edcsnw4.cr.usgs.gov/adds/readme.php?symbol=ne">http://edcsnw4.cr.usgs.gov/adds/readme.php?symbol=ne</a>.  The data available in the Data Library has been composited by month rather than dekad and reprojected onto a 0.1&deg; x 0.1&deg; grid over the domain 20&deg;W to 55&deg;E and 40&deg;S to 40&deg;N.  The monthly composites for Africa were received from Chris Funk of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
