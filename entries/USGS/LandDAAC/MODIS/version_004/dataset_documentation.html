MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was launched by
NASA aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra on
December 18, 1999. A second MODIS instrument was launched May 4, 2002
on the EOS-Aqua platform.  With both instruments in operation, MODIS
provides a morning and afternoon view with global, near-daily repeat
coverage.

The MODIS single channels (MIR for middle infrared, NIR for near
infrared and Red) at 250m spatial resolution, available in the data
library, are retrieved from the MODIS vegetation index (VI) products
MOD13Q1 which contain two indices: the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a new Enhanced Vegetation Index; VI
quality information and composited surface reflectance bands including
the blue (459-479nm) the red (620-670nm), the near-infrared
(841-876nm) and the middle infrared (2105-2155nm).  The MODIS VI
algorithm operates on a per-pixel basis and relies on multiple
observations over a 16-day period to generate a composited product.
The goal of compositing methodologies is to select the best
observation, on a per pixel basis, from all the retained filtered
data, to represent each pixel over the 16-day compositing period. The
MODIS VI compositing algorithm consists of three components:

<dl>
	<dt>BRDF-C<dd> bidirectional reflectance distribution function composite. 
	<dt>CV-MVC<dd> constrained-view angle - maximum value composite, 
	<dt>MVC<dd> maximum value composite. 
</dl>
