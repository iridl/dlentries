<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

Records of streamflow can provide an account of climatic variation over a
hydrologic basin.  The ability to do so is conditioned on the absence of
confounding factors that diminish the climate signal.  A national data set
of streamflow records that are relatively free of confounding anthropogenic
influences has been developed for the purpose of studying the variation in
surface-water conditions throughout the United States.  Records in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Storage and Retrieval System
(WATSTORE) data base for active and discontinued streamflow gaging stations
through water year 1988 (that is, through September 30, 1988) were reviewed
jointly with data specialists in each USGS District office.  The resulting
collection of stations, each with its respective period of record
satisfying the qualifying criteria, is called the Hydro-Climatic Data
Network, or HCDN.  The HCDN consists of 1,659 sites throughout the United
States and its territories, totaling 73,231 water years of daily mean
discharge values.  For each station in the HCDN, information necessary for
its identification, along with any qualifying comments about the available
record and a set of descriptive watershed characteristics are provided in
tabular format in this report, both on paper and on computer disk
(enclosed). For each station in the HCDN, the appropriate daily mean
discharge values were compiled, and statistical characteristics, including
monthly mean discharges and annual mean, minimum and maximum discharges,
were derived. The discharge data values are provided in a companion report.



<h2>                         INTRODUCTION</h2>

The potential effect of climate change on continental water resources is of
critical societal importance.  Of direct relevance to the management of
water resources are questions regarding how different climatic regimes
affect the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrologic extremes and the
distribution of seasonal water balances.  By studying such hydrologic
characteristics under known past meteorologic conditions, we can better
anticipate the effects of postulated climate changes.  Conversely, records
of the past occurrence of hydrologic phenomena can indicate when a change
in the pattern of the prevailing meteorologic fluxes and hence, a change in
climate, may have occurred.
<p>
It has long been known that surface-water conditions are generally
correlated with fluctuations in meteorologic variables such as
precipitation and temperature.  (For example, see discussion by Newell,
1891.)  However, the dynamics of streamflow are not just a simple
first-order response to existing atmospheric conditions.  "Streamflow", the
surface-water discharge measured in a natural channel, differs from
"runoff", the fraction of precipitation that appears in surface streams.
(Definitions taken from Langbein and Iseri: 1960.)  There is a complex,
interactive relationship between hydrologic conditions and meteorologic
fluxes.  Inputs from diverse specific local precipitation events are
collected over the surface of the watershed, so that the meteorologic
fluxes are spatially integrated by the watershed.  Meteorologic events and
conditions are also temporally integrated because the watershed retains
moisture both on and below its surface.  Storage on the land surface occurs
primarily in lakes, ponds and wetlands and in the seasonal or even
multiyear accumulations of snow, as well as in the biomass covering the
surface.  Storage in the subsurface occurs in both the unsaturated and the
saturated zones.  Furthermore, water can enter or leave the watershed
through the subsurface.  Losses of water to the atmosphere (through
evaporative and transpirative processes) occur throughout the watershed.
This moisture may return again to the watershed as precipitation or it may
leave the watershed entirely by advection.  Thus, the watershed acts to
dampen the noisy signal of specific instantaneous and local meteorologic
events.  Records of streamflow can provide a filtered account of
meteorologic fluctuations over the watershed i.e., of prevailing climatic
conditions.
<p>
The ability of streamflow records to reflect variations in the prevailing
climate is conditioned on the absence of any other major causes that would
radically alter streamflow patterns during the period of record.  Such
confounding processes would generally be anthropogenic in origin, that is,
induced by human activity, either intentionally or unintentionally.  Some
human actions, such as the removal of water from a stream for consumptive
use or the regulation of extremes by a control structure, have a direct
effect on streamflow patterns.  For other activities, the consequences may
be indirect but can be equally significant, such as the effects of a change
in the watershed storage capacity due to major land-use changes during the
period of record.  In either case, the pattern of past climate variation to
be discerned in the streamflow record would be confounded by changes
induced by anthropogenic activity.  An exception might be made, however, if
the non-climatic forcing factor was consistent in its nature and degree
over the period of record.  In this case, the effects are present as a
constant background level within the record.  In this case, the record of
streamflow measured at a surface-water gaging station in the watershed
could still be useful for the study of past climate variation.
<p>
A significant potential effect of a change in prevailing climatic
conditions would be a shift in the seasonal patterns of precipitation and
temperature that could induce a seasonal shift in the timing of hydrologic
events as well. Such a change in the hydrologic patterns could only be
discerned in a record whose values represent the average streamflow
conditions over a sufficiently small time span, one that is shorter than
the interval of the induced effect. In the case of a seasonal shift, the
time step within the hydrologic record should be at least a month.  Thus,
the criteria for the suitability of a streamflow record for the study of
potential effects of climate variation is that the discharge values be
representative of at most monthly mean conditions and that the effects of
anthropogenic controls, either intentional or unintentional, should be
negligible for the average discharge over the time step of the record.
<p>
In order to characterize the variation in streamflow over the land area of
the United States during the last past century, a period of great temporal
and spatial climatic variation on the North American continent (for
example, see discussion by Diaz, 1986), and to contrast this variation with
that of concurrent meteorological conditions, it is necessary to assemble a
large data set of suitable and long streamflow records. The primary source
of such information for the United States is the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS). Currently, streamflow data are collected by nationally standardized
procedures through the activities of the USGS network of District offices.
(Except for three multi-State Districts, each District office corresponds
administratively to a single State.)  A discussion of these national
procedures for the measurement and computation of streamflow can be found
in the report of Rantz and others (1982).
<p>
The USGS National Water Storage and Retrieval System (WATSTORE) data base
contains streamflow records for the United States and its trust territories
going back into the 19th century.  (See Hutchinson and others, 1975, for a
description of the structure of WATSTORE.)  The data base even contains
data that predate the establishment of the initial USGS gaging station on
the Colorado River at Embudo, New Mexico, in 1888 (Frazier and Heckler,
1972) that were deemed to be of appropriate quality and to satisfy
appropriate standard practices.  Streamflow data are available in published
form, such as in the annual State Water Data Reports, and in electronic
form from WATSTORE through the USGS National Water Data Exchange (NAWDEX)
Office.  (For contact information, see Blackwell, 1991, or Dodd and others,
1989.)  However, given the development thathas occurred throughout the
United States over the last century, many of the records in WATSTORE are
affected, entirely or after some date, by confounding anthropogenic
activities, such as discussed above.  Thus, many records are not
appropriate for the study of climate variation Consequently, an effort was
undertaken to identify and assemble the long records of daily mean
discharge held by the USGS that are relatively free from confounding
anthropogenic effects, as judged according to a single set of consistent
criteria.



<h2>          DEVELOPMENT OF THE HYDRO-CLIMATIC DATA NETWORK</h2>

Spatial patterns of temporal streamflow variation have been discussed in
myriad reports in the hydrologic literature. Diverse collections of
streamflow records have provided the data bases for these studies.  In
undertaking the work reported herein, an attempt was specifically made to
first assemble the various USGS streamflow datacollections that have been
used in the analysis of surface-water conditions on a meso- or a
continental scale.  These collections include:  (1) the USGS National Water
Conditions data set (as constituted for the 1988 "National Water
Conditions" monthly reports); (2) the Hardison (1974) data set, which has
been used in many flood studies (such as in Landwehr and others, 1978); (3)
the MINI-Regions data set (by Matalas and Landwehr, 1978, and used in
Thomas, 1981, and Marin, 1983); (4) the Langbein-Slack (1982) data set(also
used by Lins, 1985), (5) the Alley-Lins data set (written communication,
1983, and as used in Karl and Riebsame, 1989); and (6) the drought index
set used in the 1988-1989 National Water Summary (see Paulson and others,
1991).  Stations in the USGS Hydrologic Benchmark Network, which was
established to document effects of climate variation on pristine watersheds
(see Leopold, 1962; Cobb and Biesecker, 1971; and Lawrence, 1987), also
were specifically considered for this endeavor.  In addition, stations in
the National Stream Quality Accounting Network i.e., NASQAN (see Ficke and
Hawkinson, 1975.), which has been used to study continental-scale water
quality conditions (see, for example, Smith and others, 1987), were
examined.  NASQAN was considered for completeness of the effort even though
it was known apriori that many station records from this network would be
unsuitable for the discernment of the effects of climate variation because
the objective of NASQAN is to account for the cumulative impacts on water
quality from all activities in the watershed, including anthropogenic
effects.
<p>
With respect to the National Water Conditions data set, the USGS publishes
monthly a report that geographically summarizes patterns of monthly mean
discharge conditions at the nationally distributed sites.  Currently
entitled "National Water Conditions", the publication was begun inOctober
1944, under the title "Water Resources Review." (See discussion in Holmes,
1987.)  The stations comprising the data set are referred to as "National
Water Conditions Streamflow Index Stations" or just "Index Stations."  The
composition of the collection has changed over time.  For example, the set
current in 1988 as used in development of HCDN was slightly amended in
1989; see discussion of changes in "National Water Conditions October
1989."  This collection of stations, in its entirety or as subsets of the
whole, has served as the source of data for many studies of continental and
regional streamflow patterns beginning with those of Harbeck and Langbein
(1949).  (Also see Busby, 1963; Bartlein, 1982; and Cayan and Peterson,
1989, as examples of uses of this data set.)  It should be noted that in
some cases, the data used in the monthly report does not reside in
WATSTORE.  Rather, the data may be furnished by another agency, such as the
U. S. Corps of Engineers, or the discharge values are adjusted to account
for impoundments, using additional information provided by another agency
or one of the USGS District offices.  In such cases, the data values in the
monthly report reside only in the files of the USGS office that prepared
it, namely the Hydrologic Information Unit of the USGS Water Resources
Division.
<p>
Station lists from all of the above collections were compiled.  It was not
expected that the data sets would be congruent; however, it was expected
that there would be a large overlap among them.  That this was not found to
be the case suggested that still other appropriate streamflow records for
yet other stations might exist within the USGS files.  H. C. Riggs (of the
Office of Surface-Water of the USGS Water Resources Division) provided an
initial review of the various annual State Water Data Reports, and verified
that such data did exist.  (H. C. Riggs, USGS, oral communication, 1988.)
<p>
The effort was then enlarged with the intent of identifying as many as
possible of the discharge records held by the USGS whose monthly mean
values would be appropriate for the study of the relationship of hydrologic
conditions with meso-scale climate variation, as determined by a single set
of criteria.  Given that the USGS has spent considerable effort in
automating the streamflow data files, searching WATSTORE is, for practical
purposes, synonymous with choosing from all available daily mean discharge
data held by the USGS.  Given that daily mean discharge records are
available for more than 12,000 surface-water gaging stations, both active
and inactive, with in the WATSTORE data base, and given that the criteria
required specific information about watershed conditions frequently
available only from the originating District office, the help of a
surface-water specialist in each District office was enlisted.  The
criteria by which station records were designated as acceptable for
inclusion in the HCDN are as follows.
<ol>
<li> Availability of data in electronic form -- Because of the functional
requirement to handle large quantities of information, data had to be
available in electronic format in the USGS national streamflow data base
i.e., WATSTORE. It is possible that some files have never been automated,
but no such files were discovered during this effort.  However, some small
special-purpose files kept by a single office, such as that noted for the
National Water Conditions report which contains both "adjusted" and
measured discharge, may exist.  No such files were examined for this
effort.

<li> Breadth of coverage -- Records from any station, whether currently
active or not, for any water year through water year 1988 were considered.
(A water year is defined as the 12-month period, beginning on October 1 and
continuing through September 30 and is designated by the calendar year in
which it ends.)  This criterion insured the broadest possible geographic
and temporal coverage with respect to representation of diverse climatic
and watershed conditions.  (Note that no statement is made concerning the
suitability of records for water year 1989 or later.)

<li> Length of record -- A record of at least 20 water years of suitable
monthly discharge data was preferred. However, if an otherwise acceptable
record was shorter than 20 water years and that record was available for a
uniquely located surface-water gaging station, one that was located in an
otherwise underrepresented geographic area or climatic condition, then that
record was included in the HCDN. Conversely, if a long record was available
for a station but only a portion of the record was suitable by the HCDN
criteria, then only the unimpaired part of the record was selected for
inclusion in the final data set.  Explanatory comments are provided if the
selected record was shorter than 20 years or if it was less than the entire
period of record available for the station.

<li> Accuracy of the records -- The predominant accuracy rating assigned by
the District office had to be at least "good" for the record of daily mean
discharges in those water years chosen.  The occurrence of a few days which
are rated "poor" or "fair", such as may be assigned to an estimated value
at a time of unusual flow conditions due to ice impairment (see, for
example, discussion by Melcher and Walker, 1990) or other such extenuating
considerations, were not necessarily sufficient to disqualify a station.
Even a few years rated "poor" or "fair" out of a long record generally
rated "good" or "excellent" were not reason to disqualify the station.
However, a comment is included in the description of the station (given in
table 1) if such a qualification exists.
<p>
The rating assigned to a record of daily mean discharge reflects the
professional judgment of the office that obtains and prepares the records.
The rating of overall accuracy is conditioned on the accuracy of the stage
measurements, the stability of the stage-discharge relationship, the
accuracy and the frequency with which discharge measurements are made to
establish the stage-discharge relationship, and the interpretation of the
records.  An accuracy of "good" implies that 95 per cent of the daily mean
discharge values are assessed to be at least within 10 per cent of the true
value.  A discussion of the accuracy of the records and the assignment of
ratings can be found in the USGS Water-Data Reports for each State,
published annually, as well as in the report by Rantz and others (1982).

<li> Unimpaired basin conditions, at least with respect to the computation of
a monthly mean discharge value -- There should be no overt adjustment of
"natural" streamflow, such as flow diversion or augmentation, regulation of
the streamflow by some containment structure, or reduction of base flow by
extreme ground-water pumping, nor should the degree of human activity in
the watershed, such as changes in land use during the period of record, be
so large as to significantly affect the value of monthly mean discharge
(computed on the basis of the daily mean discharge) at the station.  Even
if a station is not presently suitable because of regulation, diversion,
augmentation and so forth, but an earlier period of the record available
for the station is acceptable by the specified criteria, then the suitable
period and only the suitable period was included in the HCDN.
<p>
Although discharge records that were subject to diversion or streamflow
transfers of any kind were generally not acceptable for inclusion in the
HCDN, an exception was made if the diversion had existed virtually
unchanged for the entire period of record -- that is, a diversion may exist
and affect the actual value of streamflow, but its effect on the daily mean
discharge record is unchanging and should not significantly mask the
influence of climate variation in the record.  Similarly, stations where
streamflow was subject to regulation by dams were generally not acceptable.
However, if the regulation was due to a low-head hydropower dam with a
reservoir of small storage capacity having only a transient effect on high
or low streamflow, with no effect on the monthly mean discharge values,
then the discharge record for the station could be acceptable for inclusion
in the HCDN.  On the other hand, a station in a basin that has undergone a
substantial land-cover change, for example from forest to agriculture to
urban, is probably not suitable even if the changes were gradual.
<p>
It is noted that a streamflow record was considered suitable for inclusion
in the HCDN if the monthly mean discharge values met the criterion for
nonimpairment of "natural" streamflow conditions.  However, for the
majority of records, even the daily mean discharges satisfy this criterion.
Consequently, if a record should be considered unimpaired only at a monthly
or longer average time step, this qualification is given as a comment which
accompanies the identifying information for the station.

<li> Measured discharge values -- The discharge data reported in the records
have been obtained by means of standard measurement practices followed by
the USGS. Occasionally, some discharge values in the published record will
be designated as "estimated".  Such a designation arises when the stage
height recorder malfunctions, for example, due to ice conditions.  If there
is an excessive number of estimated values in the monthly record, the
assigned rating will be less than "good" and the record will be
disqualified by the accuracy criterion.  Also, if there is a measured
diversion upstream from a surface-water gaging station, such as for
irrigation, which is routinely and simply added onto the streamflow
measured at the gaging site, then the corrected discharge record was used
in the HCDN, but with a comment qualifying the station's record. However,
the HCDN contains no records that are "constructed", that is, do not
correspond to the flow in any single natural channel, for example, the Four
Rivers Index of the Sacramento Basin, nor does the HCDN contain records
that are re-constructed using information from other sites or information
on activities such as diversions, augmentation, pumping, and regulation,
such as the reconstructed record of "natural flow" available for the
Colorado River at Lee's Ferry.  Neither was any attempt made to extend or
"fill in" sections of records with missing values using some computational
algorithm.  Thus, one need not ask if any patterns to be seen in the data
have been introduced by the choice of computational algorithm to extend the
records; rather they reflect what was determined from measurements made at
the gage at the time represented in the record.
<p>
Special attention was paid to stations that are included in either the
Hydrologic Benchmark Network or in the National Conditions Streamflow Index
Stations set used in the 1988 monthly National Water Conditions reports.
The objectives for defining both of these data collections are allied to
the purpose for which the HCDN was constructed, and both have been of
particular interest to meso-scale climate studies in the past.  If any
station in either of these two data sets was deemed not to be acceptable
for inclusion in the HCDN by the criteria specified above, then that
station was specifically identified as "rejected" for inclusion in the
HCDN, with an explanation given for its unacceptability. For example,
Crater Lake, Oregon, is a Hydrologic Benchmark station but the station
records lake levels, not streamflow. Similarly, the St. Lawrence River at
Cornwall, Ontario, near Massena, New York, is a National Water Conditions
station even though the flow has been regulated in accordance with an
international joint agreement with Canada since 1958. Indeed, there is no
actual gaging station at the site; rather, the reported discharge is
constructed on the basis of discharge at several points of regulation
upstream from the site.  Thus, records from these two sites are not
included in the HCDN.

<h2>          CONTENTS OF THE HYDRO-CLIMATIC DATA NETWORK</h2>

A total of 73,231 water years of daily mean discharge data at 1,659 gaging
stations were identified as satisfying the criteria for inclusion in the
HCDN.  Station identification and basin description information were taken
from the WATSTORE Station Header and Basin Characteristics Files,
respectively.  The station identification information, the basin
description information, and any qualifying comments for each station have
been summarized in several tables in this report, as discussed below.  The
tables appear both on paper and in electronic form (on the enclosed
Hydro-Climatic Data Network Information Disk) in this report.  For each
station and water year of record deemed to meet the HCDN criteria, the
daily mean discharge values were retrieved from the USGS WATSTORE Daily
Values File.  For each water year included in the HCDN, monthly and annual
mean discharge values were computed, and the annual minimum and maximum
values of the daily mean discharges were identified.  The entire HCDN data
set is available through the USGS NAWDEX Office.
<p>
The geographic distribution of the HCDN stations throughout the United
States, in relation to State and hydrologic boundaries, is shown in figure
1a-1e.  The network density indicates a natural constraint: there are more
streamflow gaging stations in the humid regions of the United States than
in the arid zones.  The length of acceptable record available at each HCDN
station is shown in figure 2.  The geographic distribution of the length of
acceptable records reflects both the history of the streamflow gaging
program of the USGS, which began in the arid regions west of the 100th
meridian, and the history of the settlement of the United States, beginning
in the humid East.  The number of stations with a suitable record of given
length, for the range of record lengths, is plotted in figure 3.  Snapshots
of the data set at four different times in the development of the USGS
streamflow gaging program are shown in figure 4.  In contrast, the total
number of stations for which suitable data is available in any given water
year is plotted in figure 5.  It can be seen that after 1970 there is a
national decline in the number of stations for which data is available.
This can be attributed to several causes, including (1) a decrease in
cooperative funding of streamflow gaging stations by several States,
leading to the termination of data collection a sufficient number of sites
in those States to have national consequences cumulatively; (2) increased
streamflow regulation; and (3) increased urbanization.  The geographic
distribution of one of the basin characteristics available for the HCDN
stations -- namely, the mean annual precipitation within the watershed --
is shown in Figure 6.  The figure further emphasizes the occurrence of
streamflow gaging stations in humid areas. The geographic distribution of
the size of the drainage areas for the HCDN stations is shown in figure 7.
This information is also summarized in figure 8, where the number of
stations and the total number of suitable water years of daily mean
discharge available are plotted over the range of sizes of the drainage
areas of the HCDN stations.
<p>
A complete compilation of all of the station identification and descriptive
information as well as any qualifying comments for each station are given
in table 1, which is to be found at the end of the report.  The HCDN
station entries are given in order by USGS station number.  The identifying
information was taken primarily from the USGS WATSTORE Station Header file.
It includes the USGS station number, the name of the station (reproduced
exactly as officially given in the Station Header file), the latitude and
longitude of the station, and the State and a code for the County in which
the station is located.  (The County codes are found in Appendix C, Chapter
3, Volume I, of the WATSTORE User's Guide by Hutchinson and others, 1975,
and correspond to the Federal Information Processing Standards; i.e., FIPS,
codes.)  If the USGS District office responsible for the maintenance of the
station is in a State other than that in which the station is located, the
responsible District office is also identified.  The 8-digit Hydrologic
Unit Code (HUC), which uniquely identifies the geographic area representing
part or all of the drainage basin is given for the station.  (See Seaber
and others, 1987, for a description of the delineation of hydrologic
units.)  The first two digits of the HUC denote in which of the 21 water-
resources regions within the United States and its territories the station
is located.  The gage datum, which serves as a reference point in
determining stage and may be assigned to any arbitrary reference point, is
given here because it usually corresponds to the approximate height above
sea level (<a href=#NGVD>NGVD of 1929</a>) at the gage.  The drainage area of the stream at
the specific station location is provided, and the percentage of
noncontributing area is given only if there is any such in the drainage
basin.  In addition, if the station is a National Water Conditions Stream
Index or Hydrologic Benchmark Network station, it is so identified.
<p>
Any comments about the record available for the station in the HCDN are
given in table 1.  These include any qualifications about watershed
conditions with respect to the suitability of the record as defined by the
HCDN criteria as well as explanations for short records, as needed.  If
only monthly mean discharge values or if only a part of the entire period
of record are accepted for inclusion in the HCDN, this is noted in the
comments for the station, as well.  Finally, an explanation is provided for
rejecting any Hydrologic Benchmark Network or National Water Conditions
station, if it was deemed unacceptable for inclusion in the HCDN.  (Note
that a list of just the comments for each station can be found in the file
COMMENTS.DAT on the enclosed disk.)
<p>
Finally, table 1 provides a snapshot of the length of acceptable record
available for the station.  The number of water years for which data is
acceptable by the HCDN criteria is given, along with a graphical depiction
of the acceptable water years in the station's record.  Water years for
which the data is acceptable are denoted by an "*" on the dashed time line,
which begins in water year 1874 and runs through water year 1988.
<p>
For ease in searching for stations by location or by length of record, the
contents of table 1 are restated in tables 2 and 3, respectively, following
table 1 in the back of the report.  Stations are listed in order of station
number.  Table 2 provides a concise summary of the station identification
information given in table 1 for each HCDN station, as well as for any
Hydrologic Benchmark Network or National Water Conditions station even if
rejected, that is, deemed unacceptable for inclusion in the HCDN as defined
by the criteria discussed above.  (Table 2 corresponds to the file
STATIONS.DAT on the enclosed disk.)  Table 3 provides a summary of the
record available at each station, giving both the number of water years of
suitable data and the time line that graphically depicts the acceptable
water years in the record available for the station.  (Table 3 corresponds
to the file WYEARS.DAT found on the enclosed disk.)
<p>
Table 4 (at the back of the report) contains the values of 11 watershed
characteristics for each station in the HCDN, as taken from the WATSTORE
Basin Characteristics File.  These include main channel slope, stream
length from gage to basin divide, mean basin elevation (measured from
topographic maps by transparent grid sampling method), surface storage area
of lakes, ponds and swamps in percent of contributing drainage area, area
of lakes and ponds in percent of contributing drainage area, forested area
in percent of contributing drainage area, area of glaciers in percent of
contributing drainage area, soil (infiltration) index from the Soil
Conservation Service, mean annual precipitation, precipitation intensity in
24 hours expected on the average of once each 2 years, and the mean minimum
January temperatures.  (For a further discussion of these characteristics,
see Thomas and Benson, 1970, or Dempster, 1983.)  Unlike the discharge data
and the station identifying information in the previous tables, the values
given in table 4 were taken with minimal review from WATSTORE.
<p>
The WATSTORE Basin Characteristics file was created for use in regional
streamflow regression studies in 1970 (U.S. Geological Survey, written
communication, 1970; also, discussed by Benson and Carter, 1973).  It was
last updated nationally in 1978 (U.S. Geological Survey, written
communication, 1977) for a minimum set of required characteristics.  These
included all but three of those given in table 4, namely, area of lakes and
ponds in percent of contributing drainage area, area of glaciers in percent
of contributing drainage area, and soil (infiltration) index.  Since that
time, the file has been maintained and updated on a State-specific and
generally study-specific basis by many different people.  Consistent edit
procedures were implemented in 1981.  Although much of the information in
the Basin Characteristics File warrants an "excellent" or "good" accuracy
rating, it should be noted that the contents of the file has been subject
to variable quality control measures over time.  However, the data are of
sufficient accuracy for qualitative comparisons and the information is
valuable for its aggregate availability.  It is provided in table 4 as
auxiliary information for the HCDN stations.  (Table 4 corresponds to the
file BASINS.DAT found on the enclosed disk.)
<p>
Any stations found in either the National Water Conditions Streamflow Index
set or in the Hydrologic Benchmark Network for which the available
discharge records were considered to be unacceptable for inclusion in the
HCDN are given in table 5 (at the back of the report).  The stations are
specifically noted here as exceptions because the discharge records
available for these stations have frequently been used to study hydrologic
variation in relation to climatic conditions, an objective of the HCDN.
The list of stations not included in the HCDN although they are found in
either the National Water Conditions Streamflow Index set or in the
Hydrologic Benchmark Network totals 44, including 39 that have been used in
the monthly National Water Conditions Reports and 5 that have been part of
the Hydrologic Benchmark Network.

The distribution of the HCDN station information among the 21
water-resource regions is summarized in table 6 (at the back of the
report).  The table gives not only the number of stations per region but
also the total number of water years for which the data are acceptable by
the HCDN criteria.  The stations are further differentiated into those for
which the records of daily mean discharge are acceptable by the HCDN
criteria and those for which only monthly mean discharge values are
acceptable, as well as into those stations for which the entire period of
record is acceptable in contrast to only part of the available record.  For
most stations, the entire period of record is acceptable according to the
HCDN criteria, even with regard to daily mean discharge values.



<h2>                              SUMMARY</h2>


The Hydro-Climatic Data Network -- HCDN -- has been defined and
constructed.  The HCDN is a national data set of relatively long streamflow
records that are predominantly free of anthropogenic influences.  These
records are suitable for the study of variation of surface-water conditions
in relation to climate variation over the last century, the period for
which gaged streamflow records are available.  To construct the HCDN, the
USGS WATSTORE data base, the primary repository of streamflow records for
the United States, was examined by a consistent set of criteria to identify
all suitable streamflow records.  With the assistance of surface-water
specialists in each State, a total of 73,231 water years of daily mean
discharge record at 1,659 gaging stations were identified as acceptable for
inclusion in the HCDN by the defining criteria.  This report identifies
those stations with their respective acceptable period of record, which
together constitute the HCDN.  In addition to information identifying the
stations, basin description information is also provided for each station.
The information is presented both in published tables in this report, and
in electronic format on the enclosed disk, entitled the Hydro-Climatic Data
Network Information Disk. For the acceptable water years, the daily mean
discharge data were extracted from WATSTORE and verified.  In addition to
compiling the daily mean discharges, the monthly and annual mean values
were computed, and the annual minimum and maximum values were identified
for each water year.  The streamflow data for the HCDN can be obtained
through the USGS NAWDEX Office.
