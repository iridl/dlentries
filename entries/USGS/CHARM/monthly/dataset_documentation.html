README file for CHARM
The Collaborative Historical African Rainfall Model 


CHARM combines gridded NCEP/NCAR reanalysis precipitation 
fields, interpolated rain gauge data and diagnostic estimates 
of orographic rainfall. For a description of the Reanalysis 
process please see Kalnay, 1996.  The interpolated fields are 
the 'Climatologically Assisted Interpolation' fields provided 
by Willmott and Matsura at the University of Delaware (see 
Willmott and Matsura, 1995; Willmott and Robeson, 1996 for 
details). The orographic rainfall model was developed by Funk 
and Michalsen. More details on the CHARM process can be found 
at oya.geog.ucsb.edu/charm_paper/charm.2.8.htm.


All monthly and dekadal accumulations are in binary format, 
as 2 byte signed integers. Each file has 751 columns and 801 
rows. Each cell spans 0.1 x 0.1 degrees.  The first datum of 
each file corresponds to the upper-left (north-west) corner,
and is centered at 40.05N latitude and 20.05W longitude.  The 
units of accumulations files are in millimeters. Negative values 
denote missing pixels. These should only arise over sea or lake 
locations.
