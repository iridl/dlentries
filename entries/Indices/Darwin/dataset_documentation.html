<b>Important Note:</b>As of approximately 2200 UTC on 25 Feb 2014, the Darwin sea level pressure anomaly and standardized anomaly data in this dataset were fully replaced with data calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period and placed in a sub-dataset that is so labeled.  Before this date, anomaly and standardized anomaly data values in this dataset before January 2011 contained anomalies calculated with respect to the 1971-2000 base period, and data from January 2011 onward contained anomalies calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period.

The data are available here as a <a

including an interactive data viewer and downloadable data files.
</p>
<p> These Sea Level Pressure (SLP) measurements at Darwin, Australia,
were
originally provided to us by Julie Cole. They covered the period
from Jan of 1882 through early 1991.<br>
</p>
<p>The updated data are now being downloaded on a monthly basis from
the U.S. Climate Prediction Center (CPC):<br>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/data/indices/">http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/data/indices/</a><br>
</p>
<p>The historical sea level pressure data from Darwin, covering the
period 1882-1950 are here merged with the updated sea level pressure
data, covering the period 1951-present.&nbsp; These are listed
separately at the CPC site.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>The sea level pressure values are given here (and at the CPC site)
in terms of the original sea level pressure value (in millibars, mb,
i.e., hectopascals) minus 1000 mb.&nbsp; For example, an original value
of 1011.3 mb is displayed as 11.3.<br>
</p>
<p>Besides the sea level pressure variable, sea level pressure anomaly
and standardized sea level pressure anomaly variables are available as
well.&nbsp; A frequently asked questions (FAQ) page at the CPC that
describes the indices and the base period used for the anomalies can be
found here:&nbsp; <a

<p>	
	These Sea Level Pressure (SLP) measurements at Darwin was
provided to us by Julie Cole (now located at?).  It covered the period
from Jan of 1882 through early 1991.  I located a source for
continuing updated information at the CAC climate bulletin:
<p>
	nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices
<p>
The climate bulletin runs from 1951 through the present and its contents
are identical with the period Jan 1951 through early 1991 provided by
Julie.  The source of the earlier segment of the record are not known
to me.
<p>
This is an important index for measuring ENSO.
<p>
	The values are in millibars over
the value of 1000 (i.e. a SLP measurement of 1107 is shown as 107).
