    <h1>Tahiti SLP data set</h1>
<p>
<b>Important Note:</b>As of approximately 2300 UTC on 25 Feb 2014, the Tahiti sea level pressure anomaly and standardized anomaly data in this dataset were fully replaced with data calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period and placed in a sub-dataset that is so labeled.  Before this date, anomaly and standardized anomaly data values in this dataset before January 2011 contained anomalies calculated with respect to the 1971-2000 base period, and data from January 2011 onward contained anomalies calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period.

<p>
The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.Tahiti/.slp/">here</a>.

<p>	
	These Sea Level Pressure (SLP) measurements at Tahiti are
provided by the CAC climate bulletin:
<p>
	<a href="file://nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices">nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices</a>
<p>
This is an important index for measuring ENSO.

<p>
The climate bulletin runs from 1951 through the present.
