<p><b>Important Note:</b>As of 2100 UTC on 27 Aug 2012, the SOI data in this dataset were fully replaced with data from CPC whose anomalies
were calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period.  Before this date, SOI data values in this dataset before January 2011 contained
 anomalies calculated with respect to the 1971-2000 base period, and data from January 2011 onward contained 
anomalies calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 base period. 
</p>
The data are available here as a <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.soi/">dataset</a>, including an interactive data viewer and downloadable data files.

<p> The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is the difference between the
	standardized Tahiti Sea Level Pressure (SLP) and the
	standardized Darwin SLP measurements. They are provided by the
	CAC climate bulletin:
<p>
	<a href="file://nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices">nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices</a>
<p>
This is an important index for measuring ENSO.
<p>
The climate bulletin runs from 1951 through the present.
<p>
We also have the standardized SOI from 1881-present <a
      href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.standardized/.soi/">here</a>. The earlier data was furnished by Judy Cole.
