Hi Benno,
Richard and I have a link from the North American Drought pages at Lamont to the Dai PDSI dataset

   http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/expert/SOURCES/.NCAR/.CGD/.CAS/.Indices/.PDSI2004

which is currently password protected for just IRI access.  Richard has checked with Aiguo Dai
who has indicated that it may be distributed without restriction.  Would you be willing to add his link
and open up access to this dataset?
Thanks,
Naomi

p.s. the  new version of ingrid is working great on kage - the problem with the reanalysis monthly
data is gone.

Richard,

It is ok to post it in the IRI/LDEO site. You might want to add a link to our website
(http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/pdsi.html) where we may post periodically (e.g., annually)
updated PDSI data.

I am doing fine. Hope everything is going well at Lamont.
Aiguo
