<h2>CCSM4 CMIP5 decadal prediction exp using ocn hindcast initial conditions </h2>
<h4>Data description:</h4>
These dataset is a subset from CMIP5 decadal hindcast experiments, which is created using the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4).The ocean and sea-ice models are initialized from ocean - sea-ice hindcast simulations, which were forced with the interannually varying CORE* v2 data sets for the 60-year period covering 1948-2007. The atmosphere and land components use initial conditions
 from a 20C simulation.<p>
*CORE stands for Coordinated Ocean - ice Reference Experiments supported by the CLIVAR Working Group on Ocean Model Development.
