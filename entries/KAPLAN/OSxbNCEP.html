For 1856-1981 this is the analysis of Kaplan et al. [1998] which uses
optimal estimation in the space of 80 empirical orthogonal functions
(EOFs) in order to interpolate ship observations of the U.K. Met
Office database [Parker et al. 1994]. The data after 1981 reperesents
the projection of the NCEP OI analysis (which combines ship
observations with remote sensing data) by Reynolds and Smith [1994] on
the same set of 80 EOFs as used in Kaplan et al. [1998] in order to
provide enhanced data quality of the former in the spatial resolution
of the latter.

<b>
IMPORTANT: If you do not care about statistical hemogeneity of the
long (starting pre-1981) SST records, and just need SST data after
1981, please use 
<a href=http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IGOSS/.nmc/.monthly/.ssta/>  
the original NCEP OI data </a>. It is much better (1x1 degree
resolution weekly based) SST analysis, which was degraded in the
present product.</b>
