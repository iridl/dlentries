    NASAS-GEOSS2S FORECAST iri1</a>: On <strong>June 17th, 2025</strong>: The latest version's April and May
2025 forecast issues were entirely replaced by new files. The current latest
version is now iri1, while the previous version is renamed
<a href="/SOURCES/.Models/.NMME/.NASA-GEOSS2S/.FORECAST_iri0/">
    iri0</a> and is stopped at June 2025 issue, the moment of the change.

    CanSIPS-IC4 HINDCAST MONTHLY prsml iri1</a>: On <strong>June 17th, 2025</strong>, a new version of the the entire set of hindcast data
    files for PRMSL has been downaloaded. The former prsml variable, renamed
    prmsl_iri0, still available for reproducibiluty purposes, had inconsistent units
    switching between Pa and hPa through issue dates and members. prmsl_iri1 are all
    in Pa.

    CanSIPS-IC4 HINDCAST MONTHLY prsml iri0</a>: On <strong>June 25th, 2024</strong>, the entire set of hindcast data files have been
    updated from the provider and the DL datasets have switched to that sources.
    Analyses and downloads done prior to that date relied on another set. The whole
    set update was meant to correct:
<ul>
<li>Missing files for months August and September</li>
<li>metadata for ensemble members fix</li>
<li>PRATE values fixed</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
sst_regridded is the newly regridded SPEAR SST data.
The hindcast data spans the initialization months 199101-202012. The forecast data spans the initialization months 202101-present.
Information about the regridding:
The original SPEAR SST data regridded to the NMME grid had incorrect values in the Arctic, where the GFDL tripolar grid was not correctly accounted for in the regridding process. This newly regridded SST data is exactly the same as the original data south of 65 degrees North latitude and now has the correct values and mapping poleward of 65 degrees North latitude.

<h1>GFDL CM2.1</h1>
<p>
The GFDL assimilation systems is based on the ensemble /adjustmen/t
Kalman filter (EaKf; Anderson 2001), which is a deterministic variant
of the ensemble Kalman filter. The EaKf estimates the probability
distribution function (PDF) of climate states by combining the prior
PDF derived from model dynamics and the observational PDF. It uses a
two-step data assimilation procedure %Gâ%@ the first step
computes ensemble increments at an observation location and the second
step distributes the increments over the impacted grids - for an
ensemble Kalman filter under a local least
squares framework. In both systems the filtering process is
implemented by a multivariate linear regression with consideration of
temperature and salinity covariance (Anderson 2003). The data adjusted
ensemble members are the realizations of the analysis PDF and serve as
the initial conditions for the next ensemble integration. 
</p>
<p>
The GFDL system consists of an EaKf applied to GFDL's fully coupled
climate model CM2.1 (Delworth et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2007), which
is designed to produce a better balanced initialization as opposed to
each component model using its own assimilation system. The ocean
component of the ensemble coupled data assimilation (ECDA3.1) is the
Modular Ocean Model version 4 (MOM4) configured with 50 vertical
levels and 1° horizontal resolution, telescoping to 1/3° meridional
spacing near the equator. The atmospheric component has a resolution
of 2.5° x 2° with 24 vertical levels. The first guess is given by a
fully coupled model where the atmosphere is constrained by an existing
atmospheric analysis. Ocean observations of temperature, salinity, and
SST are assimilated using covariance structures from the coupled
model. Argo observations are included as they became available in the
post-2000 period. The cross-interface covariance structures in the
GFDL system allow for fully coupled assimilation. For the ocean
component, observed temperature and salinity profiles and SST are
assimilated daily (see details in
<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-data-assimilation">http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-data-assimilation</a>). The atmosphere is
constrained by an existing atmospheric analysis. All ECDA3.1
experiments are performed with a 12-member ensemble that is used to
compute state estimation, ensemble mean, and the spread of the
estimate. </p>
<p>
Using the ECDA analysis ensembles for initial conditions, one year
predictions of 10 ensemble members are produced beginning on the first
of every month.

<h1>IRI ECHAM4.5 Anomaly Coupled</h1>
<p>
This model is an updated version of the coupled model described in
DeWitt (2005). Improvements to the model are in the coupling scheme
and include a parameterized version of the diurnal solar cycle
following Danabasoglu et al. (2006), and inclusion of the surface
currents in the stress calculation following Luo et al. (2005) These
changes help to reduce the models near-equatorial cold bias. The
atmospheric component model is the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) ECHAM4.5
atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM; Roeckner et al., 1994)
and is initialized with forced runs using observed SST. The ocean
component model is the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)
Modular Ocean Model Version 3 (MOM3; Pacanowski and Griffies, 1998)
initialized with a Derber-Rosati (1989) temperature assimilation
scheme.

<h1>NCEP CFS v1</h1>

The CFSv1 seasonal predictions out to abt 9 months have been
    operational at NCEP since August 2004, and although already
    succeeded by CFSv2, is still running (as of early 2012 at
    least). The atmospheric component has T62L64 atmospheric
    resolution and the ocean component is a MOM3 model at 0.30
    meridional equatorial resolution. Hindcasts are available for
    1981-2009. At the time it was the first coupled atmosphere-ocean
    model at NCEP that had a) so-called 1-tier coupling as opposed to
    the earlier 2-tier or even AMIP approach, b) semi-global (about
    50S-60N) coupling in all oceans (as opposed to coupling in the
    tropical Pacific only). Details of the model components, the
    initial states and some forecast results are in Saha et al(2006).

<h1>NCEP CFS v2</h1>

The CFSv2 model became operational at NCEP, as successor of CFSv1, in
    March 2011. The atmospheric component has T128L64 atmospheric
    resolution and the ocean component is a MOM4 model at 0.25
    meridional equatorial resolution. Hindcasts out to 9 months are
    available for 1982-2010. The ocean-atmosphere coupling (more
    frequent than in v1) is now truly global, and an interactive
    sea-ice model has been added. Initial states for the integration
    are provided by a coupled Reanalysis at T382L64 resolution (Saha
    et al 2010). CFSv2 has, as much as practically possible,
    consistency between the forecast model and the initial
    states. Further details of the model components, the initial
    states and some forecast results will be in Saha et al(2012).
