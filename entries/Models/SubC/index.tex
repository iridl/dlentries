/comment (IMPORTANT NOTE: On 10 April 2018 the order of the independent variables (i.e., dimensions, or grids) for each of the SubX dependent hindcast and forecast variables in all models in the Data Library will be modified from [ X Y | S L M (P) ] to [ X Y | L M S (P) ].  It is possible that this change could affect download scripts that users may have set up in which the order of the dimensions is important.  We apologize for any inconvenience.) def
