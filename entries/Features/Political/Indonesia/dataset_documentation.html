Complete history of Indonesian provinces is available at following link:<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Indonesia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Indonesia</a><br>
<br>
Till 2003 Indonesia had 29 provinces which increased to 33 in 2004.
Some of<br>
the recent changes in province boundaries are:<br>
<br>
1- A portion of South Sumatra was split to form Banka-Belitung province
in 2000.<br>
<br>
2- A portion of West java was split to form Banten in 2000.<br>
<br>
3- South Sulawesi was split to form West Sulawesi in 2004.<br>
<br>
Rest of the provinces we interested in are unchanged. GIS map that we
have got is for the year 2000.<br>
