<h1>  The Dataset</h1>
An historical monthly precipitation dataset for global land areas from 1900 to 1996, gridded at 2.5° latitude by 3.75° longitude resolution (a 5° latitude/longitude resolution version is also available: 'g55wld0096.dat'), has been constructed and is available for use in scientific research.  This work has been supported by the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Contract EPG 1/1/48).  The following credit should be used in reports or publications, etc.:<p>

The station dataset from which this gridded dataset has been
  constructed is an extension of the original CRU/US DoE data
  described in Eischeid et al. (1991).  Substantial additional work in
  extending these station time series and increasing the network has
  been undertaken by the Climatic Research Unit in recent years.  A
  total of over 11,800 station time series now exist.  For access to
  these station data one should approach Russ Vose working on the
  Global Historical Climatology Network (<a href="/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.GHCN/.v2/">GHCN Version 2</a>) at Arizona State University, USA  (Email:  rvose@smtpl.asu.edu).<p>

<h2>  Gridding Method</h2> 

Thiessen polygon weights were used to average gauge data within
each gridbox.  Where a monthly station value was missing an estimate
was obtained by calculating the mean anomaly for that location derived
from surrounding stations.  This anomaly interpolation method required
the station values to be converted into percentage anomalies from some
reference period.  These standard anomalies were then interpolated
onto the missing station location using an inverse distance (with
spherical adjustment), angular weighted method similar to that
described in Shepherd (1984) and Legates and Willmott (1990).  For
this interpolation, a maximum percent anomaly value of 500 per cent
was imposed.  The interpolated percent anomaly was then converted back
into a station mm estimate using that station's mean monthly
precipitation total for the reference period.  This mean anomaly
interpolation was only performed for a missing station value where two
stations within a 600km radius possessed valid data.  Otherwise the
station value remained missing and hence the gridbox average could not
be calculated for that month.  A maximum of the 50 nearest stations
could contribute to the interpolation.<p> Two gridded datasets were
initially calculated based on two different reference periods: 1931-70
and 1951-90.  Stations could only contribute to these climatologies if
they possessed 75% or more valid monthly measurements in the reference
period.  For 1931-70, 5986 stations were used resulting in historical
gridded time series for 1276 2.5° by 3.75° gridboxes.  The
maximum number of stations per gridbox was 51.  For 1951-90, 6647
stations were included generating time series for 1419 2.5° by
3.75° gridboxes.  The maximum number of stations per gridbox was
45.  These two datasets were then combined using the common 1951-70
period to blend the data on the basis of mean monthly values and their
variance.  When merged, a total of 1520 gridboxes possessed time
series of which 1019 had complete data between 1900 and 1996.  The
period of most complete coverage was from 1952-70; the year 1959
possessed no missing data in any of the 813 gridboxes.

<h2>Some Notes About Reliability</h2>
All station data have been screened for gross outliers and typographical errors using a number of semi-automated techniques.  Owing to the large spatial variability of precipitation these methods, however, are not foolproof.  The GHCN has considered and implemented further improvements to these screening methods (Easterling and Peterson, 1995).<p>
No corrections for gauge undercatch have been applied to the station data (cf. Sevruk, 1982; Legates and Willmott, 1990).  A spatially varying, but temporally constant, correction could be applied to the estimates derived from Legates and Willmott (1990), although this would not alter the trends in the data.  Applying time-dependent corrections to gauge time series on a global scale is a gigantic undertaking which may well not be either feasible or justifiable.  <p>
A number of Northern Hemisphere high latitude time series contain inhomogeneities  due to varying sensitivities of different gauge designs and mountings to snowcatch.  These have been well documented for certain countries (e.g. Russia; Groisman et al., 1991) and work is underway to "clean" other country datasets (e.g. Canada and Scandinavian countries).  Groisman's adjusted data have now been added to the master station dataset used here, but further improvements in the reliability of this gridded dataset over high latitudes will follow.  For the present, the user should be cautious about the precise interpretation of high latitude precipitation trends outside Russia, especially in winter.<p>
No topographic weighting has been applied to the interpolation scheme.  A number of different methods exist for incorporating the effects of topography on precipitation (e.g. the PRISM and AURELHY methods and the spline algorithms of Hutchinson, 1995).  However, the dependence of precipitation anomalies on elevation is much smaller and more ambiguous.  Since the method used here only interpolates anomalies, and not precipitation values themselves, excluding the effects of elevation is reasonable. There are, however, other problems associated with using precipitation anomalies in a gridding algorithm like this and these are discussed by Hulme and New (1997).
