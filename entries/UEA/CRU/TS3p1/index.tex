/note (Important!:  On July 12, 2012, BADC added the following note to its CRU TS3.1 documentation page:  "A systematic
error was discovered in the CRUTS v3.01 process generating the precipitation, wet days and frost frequency data files.
New precipitation data files (version 3.01.01) have been generated and are now available in the archive.  Wet days and
frost frequency files will be made available at a later time."  The revised precipitation file and both precipitation
station count files were added to the IRI Data Library holdings on July 23, 2012, replacing the previous version of
these files.) def
