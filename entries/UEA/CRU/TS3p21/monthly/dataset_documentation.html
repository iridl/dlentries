    <h1>CRU TS3.21: Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-Series (TS) Version 3.21 of High Resolution Gridded Data of Month-by-month Variation in Climate (Jan. 1901 - Dec. 2012)</h1>
<p>
Climatic Research Unit (CRU) TS (time-series) datasets are month-by-month variations in climate over the last century or so. These are calculated on high-resolution (0.5x0.5 degree) grids, which are based on an archive of monthly average daily maximum and minimum temperatures provided by more than 4000 weather stations distributed around the world. They allow variations in climate to be studied. CRU TS 3.21 variables are cloud cover, diurnal temperature range, frost day frequency, PET, precipitation, daily mean temperature, monthly average daily maximum and minimum temperature, vapour pressure and wet day frequency for the period Jan. 1901 - Dec. 2012. In addition to updating the dataset with 2012 data, the v3.21 release corrects two errors in the v3.20 dataset.
This data is citable (DOI: 10.5285/D0E1585D-3417-485F-87AE-4FCECF10A992).

The 3.21 release of the CRU TS dataset covers the period 1901-2012. It
supercedes all earlier releases.

Differences between CRU TS v3.20 and v3.21

Summary

In addition to updating the dataset with 2012 data, the v3.21 release
corrects two errors in the v3.20 dataset. These are described in detail
below. Areal means based on country boundaries have been constructed to
aid comparison: 'comparison.cruts320vs321.PRE.pdf' and
'comparison.cruts320vs321.WET.pdf'.

1. WMO Code Error (All dates, PRE and WET variables only)

A bespoke update of the precipitation observations database in
December 2011 resulted in the corruption of some European station codes.
This resulted in the observations from a number of European stations
being relocated to countries in the Equatorial 'band'. The v3.20 release
was based on this partially-corrupted database, affecting both PRE and
WET (since WET is partially generated using synthetics derived from
PRE). Both gridded data files and station files were affected. The
relevant observations database was, of course, also affected.

The files affected are as follows:

All files beginning cru_ts3.20, for PRE and WET only
pre.1207171231.clean.dtb

In general, the station relocations took place to and from areas already
served by numerous stations, absorbing any potential changes. However,
there are exceptions:
. Where the European station extends back further in time than any of
the stations in the 'destination' region.
. Where local station density in the 'destination' region is low.
. Where local station density in the 'source' region is low.

Many countries appear to have been affected in very minor ways, but some
precipitation means have been affected in more noticeable (and perhaps
significant, depending on context) ways:

Colombia: 1901-1910
Venezuela: 1901-1920
Gabon: 1920-1940
Congo: 1901-1940
Tajikistan: 2005-2011
Israel: 2005-2011
Bulgaria: 1901-1940 and 1990-2011
Czech Republic: 2005-2011
Andorra: throughout

For wet days, the countries most affected are:

Bioko: 1915-1925
Gabon: 1930-1940
Cabinda: 1901-1940
Congo: 1915-1940
Socotra: 1925-1940
Georgia: 1920-1930

The recently-released precipitation database file for v3.20 is:

pre.1207171231.clean.dtb

This includes the corrupted metadata, and so will remain available to
assist in any analysis of the issue.


2. Missing Observations (April-August 2011; PRE and WET variables only)

An error in the database update process resulted in four almost-
completely missing months in the PRE observation database: April thru
August 2011 (inclusive). The dataset production process took the
predefined approach for sparse areas and substituted the 1961-1990
monthly climatology for these months, so the error was not immediately
apparent. The error propagated to the WET variable because of its
dependence on the PRE variable.

The files affected are as follows:

All files beginning cru_ts3.20, for PRE and WET only
pre.1207171231.clean.dtb

CRU TS/CY ADVISORY NOTE: 29 August 2013

Scope

This advisory relates to the v3.20 and v3.21 releases of the CRU TS
dataset, and to the v3.21 release of the CRU CY dataset. It concerns a
spatial area of Northeast Africa, for the PRE and WET variables only.

Summary

An error has been detected in new Mozambigue precipitation observations
introduced in 2011 for the v3.20 dataset and continuing to be used in
the v3.21 dataset. The new stations had the signs of their latitudes
swapped, so that they appeared north of the equator instead of south of
it. Thus, the erroneous station data affects cells in an area
corresponding to Mozambique if it were 'mirrored' in the equator.

The error impacts on both PRE and WET data (as WET is derived from PRE).

An examination of the error found 35 new stations that had been
incorrectly located. A test run using corrected data was used to
construct annual averages for each country, allowing comparison with
the published data (v3.21). Comparison plots are available as:

comparison.cruts321vs321mozfix.PRE.pdf
comparison.cruts321vs321mozfix.WET.pdf

A visual inspection identifies Eritrea and Egypt as those countries
showing the greatest changes, though some others show small differences
in one or two years.

Action

Users who feel their work may be affected by this error should make
contact via BADC. At this time there are no plans to issue corrections,
since the next scheduled release (3.22, covering 1901-2013) will
incorporate these. Urgent requests for corrected data will, however, be
viewed sympathetically.
