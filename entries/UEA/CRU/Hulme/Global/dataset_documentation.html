<h1 align=center>  The Dataset</h1>
<p align=center><i>'gu23wld0098.dat',  Version 1.0,  March 1999</i></p>

An historical monthly precipitation dataset for global land areas from 1900 to 1998, 
gridded at 2.5° latitude by 3.75° longitude resolution (a 5° latitude/longitude 
resolution version is also available: 'g55wld0098.dat'), has been constructed and is 
available for use in scientific research.  This work has been supported by the UK 
Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Contract EPG 1/1/48).

The station dataset from which this gridded dataset has been constructed is an 
extension of the original CRU/US DoE data described in Eischeid et al. (1991).  
Substantial additional work in extending these station time series and increasing the 
network has been undertaken by the Climatic Research Unit in recent years.  A total 
of over 11,880 station time series now exist.  For access to these station data one 
should approach Russ Vose working on the Global Historical Climatology Network 
(GHCN Version 2) at Arizona State University, USA  (Email:  rvose@smtpl.asu.edu).
<h2>Gridding Method</h2>
Thiessen polygon weights were used to average gauge data within each gridbox.  
Where a monthly station value was missing an estimate was obtained by calculating 
the mean anomaly for that location derived from surrounding stations.  This anomaly 
interpolation method required the station values to be converted into percentage 
anomalies from some reference period.  These standard anomalies were then 
interpolated onto the missing station location using an inverse distance (with spherical 
adjustment), angular weighted method similar to that described in Shepherd (1984) 
and Legates and Willmott (1990).  For this interpolation, a maximum percent 
anomaly value of 500 per cent was imposed.  The interpolated percent anomaly was 
then converted back into a station mm estimate using that station's mean monthly 
precipitation total for the reference period.  This mean anomaly interpolation was 
only performed for a missing station value where two stations within a 600km radius 
possessed valid data (for 1997 and 1998 this search radius was reduced to 400km to 
minimise instabilities in the resulting gridbox estimates).  Otherwise the station value 
remained missing and hence the gridbox average could not be calculated for that 
month.  A maximum of the 50 nearest stations could contribute to the interpolation.
<p>
Two gridded datasets were initially calculated based on two different reference 
periods: 1931-70 and 1951-90.  Stations could only contribute to these climatologies 
if they possessed 75% or more valid monthly measurements in the reference period.  
For 1931-70, 5986 stations were used resulting in historical gridded time series for 
1277 2.5° by 3.75° gridboxes.  The maximum number of stations per gridbox was 51.  
For 1951-90, 6655 stations were included generating time series for 1418 2.5° by 
3.75° gridboxes.  The maximum number of stations per gridbox was 45.  These two 
datasets were then combined using the common 1951-70 period to blend the data on 
the basis of mean monthly values and their variance.  When merged, a total of 1520 
gridboxes possessed time series of which 726 had complete data between 1900 and 
1998.  The period of most complete coverage was from 1952-75; the year 1959 
possessed no missing data in any of the 1520 gridboxes.


<h2>Some Notes About Reliability</h2>
All station data have been screened for gross outliers and typographical errors using a 
number of semi-automated techniques.  Owing to the large spatial variability of 
precipitation these methods, however, are not foolproof.  The GHCN has considered 
and implemented further improvements to these screening methods (Easterling and 
Peterson, 1995; Easterling et al., 1996).
<p>
No corrections for gauge undercatch have been applied to the station data (cf. Sevruk, 
1982; Legates and Willmott, 1990).  A spatially varying, but temporally constant, 
correction could be applied to the estimates derived from Legates and Willmott 
(1990), although this would not alter the trends in the data.  Applying time-dependent 
corrections to gauge time series on a global scale is a gigantic undertaking which may 
well not be either feasible or justifiable.  
<p>
A number of Northern Hemisphere high latitude time series contain inhomogeneities 
due to varying sensitivities to snowcatch of different gauge designs and mountings.  
These have been well documented for certain countries (e.g. Russia; Groisman et al., 
1991; Scandinavian countries - the North Atlantic Climatological Dataset) and work 
is underway to "clean" other country datasets (e.g. Canada).  Groisman's 'adjusted' 
data have now been added to the master station dataset used here, as has the NACD 
archive, but further improvements in the reliability of this gridded dataset over high 
latitudes will follow.  For the present, the user should be cautious about the precise 
interpretation of high latitude precipitation trends outside Russia and Scandinavia, 
especially in winter.
<p>
No topographic weighting has been applied to the interpolation scheme.  A number of 
different methods exist for incorporating the effects of topography on precipitation 
(e.g. the PRISM and AURELHY methods and the spline algorithms of Hutchinson, 
1995).  However, the dependence of precipitation anomalies on elevation is much 
smaller and more ambiguous.  Since the method used here only interpolates 
anomalies, and not precipitation values themselves, excluding the effects of elevation 
is reasonable. There are, however, other problems associated with using precipitation 
anomalies in a gridding algorithm like this and these are discussed by Hulme and 
New (1997).  Further discussion and applications of these, and other gridded, 
precipitation datasets can be found in the following publications:
