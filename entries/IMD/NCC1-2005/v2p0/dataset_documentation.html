<h1>IMD High Resolution (1&deg;x1&deg;) Daily Gridded Rainfall Data For the Indian Region 1951-2004 Version 2 (NCC1/2005)</h1> 
<p>
The following description is extracted from the README.txt file for this data set:
<p>
This data product is the second version of IMD gridded daily rainfall data developed in 2005.  The only difference between the earlier version and the new version is total number of stations. In the first version, we have used only 1803 stations.  In the new version, we have used 2140 stations. The details of the new version are available in the file " <a href="http://iri.columbia.edu/~mbell/DataLibrary/IMD/Note_on_new_version_v2.pdf">Note on new version_v2. pdf</a>" in the "Doc" directory.  There is no change in the methodology of development of the data.  In the new version, we have extended the analysis up to 2004.  This data is arranged in 35x33 grid points.
<p>
The data on the grid is from South to North. i.e. J=1 corresponds to lat. 6.5 N, J=2 corresponds to 7.5 N and so on.  The first data in the record is at 6.5N and 66.5E, and the second is at 6.5N, 67.5E etc.
