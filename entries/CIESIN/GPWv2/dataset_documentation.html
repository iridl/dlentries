DESCRIPTION
<p>
This ftp archive contains the final release of CIESIN, the International Food
Policy Research Institute and the World Resources Institute's Gridded Population of
the World, Version 2 (GPW) data product.  Documentation for these data is
available on the GPW web site at:
<p>
<a href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/plue/gpw/">http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/plue/gpw/</a>
<p>
This is the final release of the GPW product. If you should discover any
problems or errors, please inform us at:
<p><address>
gpw@ciesin.columbia.edu
</address>
<p>
The archive contains grid for the world, continental breakdowns and individual
countries as zipped individual ArcInfo interchange files and tarred Band
Interleaved by Line (BIL) formats.  The BIL format grids have been
rounded to the nearest whole number and are stored in integer format while
the ArcInfo interchange files store floating point (decimal) values. The grids
are contained by region on CIESIN's ftp site (ftp.ciesin.columbia.edu) in
subdirectories as follows:
<p><pre>
pub/gpw/global		Grids for the World
pub/gpw/africa		Grids for Africa
pub/gpw/asia		Grids for Asia
pub/gpw/europe		Grids for Europe
pub/gpw/n_america 	Grids for North America
pub/gpw/oceania		Grids for Oceania
pub/gpw/s_america 	Grids for South America
</pre>
<p>
See the file n_convention.txt on the ftp site in /pub/gpw/ for details on 
the naming conventions of the grids.
<p>
Ancillary data are available in pub/gpw/ancillary/ and low resolution versions
of the grids are available in /pub/gpw/lowres/

NOTES FOR ARCVIEW USERS
<p>
The ArcInfo interchange files on the ftp server can be converted to 
grids using ESRI's Import71 utility.  However, this utility is much slower at 
creating the global and continental grids than the ArcInfo import command.  
Downloading the BIL format data and converting them to grids using ArcView's 
'Convert to Grid' option is a quicker way to access the grids.
<p>
There seems to be a bug in arcview which prevents the correct display of
some grids in a view or a layout according to the legend.  The bug
affects grids with a range greater than 1-1,000,000 for floating point grids  
and 1-100,000 for integer grids.  The grid values are correct but the colors
are not the ones in the legend.  The workaround around is to reclass the 
grid into the classes that you want to draw (as long as you don't want > 
100,000 colors on your map!).
