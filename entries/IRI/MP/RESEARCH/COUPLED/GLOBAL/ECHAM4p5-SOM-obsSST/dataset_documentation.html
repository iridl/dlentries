<h4>ECHAM4.5 T42 AGCM with mixed layer model</h4>
This model is ECHAM4.5 T42 AGCM coupled to a spatially varying but constant in
time mixed layer model.
This version of the model prescribes SST in the tropical and
subtropical eastern and central Pacific but predicts it elsewere. <a href="SOMSSTMask.pdf">Here</a> is
where the SST is predicted (purple  shading) and prescribed (red shading).<p>
This is the same model as described at:
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IRI/.FD/.ECHAM4p5/.History/>IRI FD ECHAM4p5</a>,

and include the same SST data in the region for the figure that I had sent out 
with my e-mail. In the rest of the oceans a simple mixed layer model is 
used to solve for the SST. The mixed layer model uses a spatially variable but 
constant in time mixed layer depth which was determined using the Levitus (1994) 
criteria. A Q-Flux has been determined from a long run using the climatological SST 
in order to have the mixed layer model be able to reproduce that part of the SST 
tendency due to ocean dynamics. Also, implicitly included in this Q-Flux would be 
a correction term to the model heat flux, i.e. this can not be separated from the 
pure dynamics case.



<p>
  Currently,
there are 3 integrations with monthly mean data.
The integrations are the same except for the initial condition which was used.
<p>
If anyone would like to provide feedback on these integrations I would greatly appreciate it. In particular, the region where the SST is
prescribed is always somewhat abritray as is how this is blended with the predicted SST  region. The region of prescribed SST was chosen to
allow as complete a representation of the central and eastern Pacific interannual variability a possible while also allowing the
western Pacific to evolve freely.
