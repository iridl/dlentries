    <h1>Monthly to Pentad Unaveraging</h1>
  This operator
inverts the averaging operator using a .5 month correlation scale.  
 This means we find a smooth solution that averages to the monthly climatology.  It is only an interpolation.
<p>
Suppose we use the following notation:
<dl compact>
<dt><b>|m&gt;</b>
<dd>vector of monthly data
<dt><b>[est&gt;</b>
<dd>vector of pentad data
<dt><b>|A]</b>
<dd>averaging operator going from pentads to months.
<dt><b>[M]</b>
<dd> model-model covariance matrix, constructed from a correlation
function exp(-T/L), where T is the time difference between the two
points and L is about .5 month.  T is periodic with period 1 year (365
days or more importantly 73 pentads).  Covariances below
10<sup>-5</sup> were set to zero.
</dl>
<b>|A]</b> is the averaging operator, so by construction
<p>
<b>|A][est&gt;</b> = <b>|m&gt;</b>
<p>
We invert this using a data-space inverse with the data-space error
  convariance set to zero (i.e. the average of our pentad estimates
  will be exactly equal to the monthly data).
<p>
<b>[est&gt;</b> = <b>[M][A|{|A][M][A|}<sup>-1</sup>|m&gt;</b>
