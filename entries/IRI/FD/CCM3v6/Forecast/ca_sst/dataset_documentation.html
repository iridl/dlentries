<H4>Constructed Analogue Forced Runs of CCM 3.6 AGCM</h4>
The retrospective ensemble experiment consists of a set  that have been made over the past several decades using predicted SST forcing, as opposed to the observed SST forcing used in simulation runs.
<p>
This set of retrospective experiments has been produced using the CCM 3.6 AGCM (T42, L18), forced with Constructed Analogue (CA) SST (van den Dool, 1994) as boundary conditions over tropical oceans (30S-30N).  Over the extra-tropical oceans, the observed SST anomalies are persisted and added to the climatological annual cycle.
   <p>                                                                                               
The retrospective forecast covers the period 1957-2002, with 0-6 months as lead time. So far, 24 ensemble member forecasts are available; the initial conditions are obtained from large ensemble simulations of each corresponding member.
