In the acknowledgment section the following information should be
included: The ECHAM5 AGCM has been developed by the Max-Planck
Institute for Meteorology and the code kindly provided to IRI for
preforming these experiments. Technical help in setting up the model
has been supplied by Luis Kornblueh, Uwe Shulzweida, and Uli Schlese
from Max-Planck. The integrations performed here were completed using
