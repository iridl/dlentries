Figure <A HREF=subsection3_5_6.html#figwstd>7</A> shows mean wind speed and standard deviation
valid at 20 m for January, both corrected (Figs. <A HREF=subsection3_5_6.html#figwstd>7</A>a,c) and
the difference of corrected minus uncorrected (Figs. <A HREF=subsection3_5_6.html#figwstd>7</A>b,d).
In this calculation all quality controlled COADS data from 1945 to
1989 were used, correcting all estimated wind speeds according to 
eq. (<A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#eqjan>6</A>).  Consistent with previous studies, corrected mean
speeds exceed uncorrected mean speeds by about 0.5 m/s in parts of the
North Atlantic, with smaller differences in the North Pacific.  The
corrected standard deviation (Figs. <A HREF=subsection3_5_6.html#figwstd>7</A>c,d) is reduced in
the extra-tropics, with a more pronounced reduction (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2985.xbm"> 0.3 m/s)
in the North Atlantic ocean. The corrected standard deviation is
generally increased in the tropics with magnitudes around 0.1 m/s in
the eastern tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  Similar
calculations for the month of July show that the correction to the
wind speed (not shown) is positive and greater than that for January,
primarily due to the lower wind speed in July.
 Consistent with the findings of Cardone <em>et al.</em>  
(1990), we note a reduction in the wind speed's temporal linear trend
for most of the globe due to our scientific Beaufort scale correction
(not shown).  This artificial upward trend in wind speed can adversely impact
studies of long term variability of the ocean-atmosphere climate
system.
