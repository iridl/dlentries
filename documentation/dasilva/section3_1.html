<P>
The compilation of the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)
as documented by Slutz <em>et al.</em>  (1985) and Woodruff <em>et al.</em> (1987) has
provided climate researchers with the most complete record of surface
marine climate to date. The availability of this data set has
contributed significantly to advancing our understanding of the
atmosphere-ocean climate system. In addition to observational studies
based on COADS, atmospheric and oceanic modelers have relied on this
data set for boundary conditions in long-term integrations of
atmospheric and oceanic circulation models.
<P>
One of the main contributions of the COADS project was to unify
several historical data sets in a single, consistent format, and to
subject the ship reports to the same quality control procedure. This
homogenized data set is available in two forms: as monthly mean summaries
in 2- by 2-degree boxes over the global oceans, and as raw individual
observations.  Due to the massive number of individual ship reports,
the majority of researchers have used the monthly mean summaries.
<P>
In addition to the directly observed quantities (sea surface
temperature, surface air temperature, etc.), COADS monthly mean
summaries include a wealth of derived quantities such as moisture and
pseudo oceanic fluxes, in which transfer coefficients have been 
ignored.
In an
attempt to extend and improve the oceanic fluxes in COADS, a
collaborative project between the Department of Geosciences of the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) and the National Oceanographic
Data Center/NOAA was initiated. The main goal of this project was to
produce high resolution (1-degree by 1-degree), stability dependent
heat and momentum fluxes, as well as evaporation, precipitation and
radiational fluxes which were absent from the COADS monthly mean
summaries. In addition to improved resolution and boundary layer
parameterizations, a new scientific Beaufort equivalent scale was
developed which reduces wind speed bias and artificial wind speed
trends in the post World War II period.
<P>
Our revised monthly mean summaries (henceforth referred to as
UWM/COADS monthly mean summaries) are available in the form of raw
monthly means, standard deviations, and number of observations in 1
by 1-degree boxes over the global oceans, from 1945 to 1989.  These
raw data are made available for those users desiring to perform their
own objective analysis. In addition, the monthly mean fields have been
objectively analyzed with essentially the same successive correction
scheme used by Levitus (1982).  It is important to note that although
the analyzed fields are given with a 1-degree grid spacing, only
wavelengths greater than about 770 km remain due to the smoothing
effects of the analysis. Climatological half-degree by half-degree
analyses have also been produced; these results will be
discussed elsewhere.
<P>
This atlas series presents objectively analyzed seasonal mean
anomalies along with climatology, standard deviations,
and observation density. This publication describes in detail the
method of analysis, bias corrections, and parameterizations adopted.
Also described is the format of the data in the UWM/COADS data set,
along with information on the software used to read the data.
The actual anomaly maps appear in subsequent volumes.  The directly
observed quantities are presented in Volume 2.  Volume 3 deals with heat
and momentum fluxes at the ocean surface. The buoyancy and fresh water
fluxes are presented in Volume 4 and additional derived quantities are
included in Volume 5.
