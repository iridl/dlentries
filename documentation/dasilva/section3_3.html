The primary data source for this study is Release 1 of
COADS which covers the
period 1854-1979. For the 1980's we rely on an interim data
product that preceded COADS Release 1A (recently made available).
Release 1A adds more observations to the interim data base
and extends it to 1993. This improved data base, which was not
available in time for our calculations, will be used in future versions
of our analyses.
<P>
As described below, our detailed calculations require the
consideration of individual ship reports.  Product 10 of COADS,
the <em>Compressed Marine Reports</em> (CMR-5), contains individual
reports of surface marine and atmospheric observations from merchant
vessels, research vessels, buoys, and bathythermographs (Woodruff
<em>et al.</em>  1987). The reports in CMR-5 include the following directly reported
quantities:
<UL><LI> zonal and meridional wind components
        <LI> air temperature
        <LI> sea surface temperature
        <LI> sea level pressure
        <LI> dew point depression 
        <LI> cloudiness
        <LI> present weather
</UL>
along with quality control indicators which are briefly described
next.  The interested reader should consult the original COADS
documentation (Slutz <em>et al.</em>  1985) for a detailed description of the
quality control procedure. Note that wind, dew point depression and
sea level pressure are not directly observed but rather calculated by
ship personnel.  When measured, the reported wind speed and
direction are computed from the anemometer reading taking in
consideration the ship velocity, a procedure that often introduces
errors. Dew point depression is computed from the measured dry and wet
bulb temperatures. Sea level pressure is computed from the measured
pressure with a height correction to reduce it to sea level.  WMO
Publication No. 47 (e.g., WMO 1990), available yearly since 
1955 (in digital form since
1973), lists all the Ships of the Voluntary Observing Fleet along with
the ship instrumentation and routes. Kent and Taylor (1991) describes
in some detail observing practice by VOS and the instruments they used
during the VSOP-NA project (May/88 to September/90).

Quality control in COADS is implemented by means of a multiple step
statistical procedure to identify ``outliers.'' The first step is to
generate <em>Decadal Summary Untrimmed Limits</em> for six variables: sea
surface temperature, air temperature, air pressure, zonal wind,
meridional wind, and humidity.  Sextiles are calculated for each
variable in every 2°  box for each decade and month.  Next, the
first, third (the median), and fifth sextiles are averaged across
latitude, longitude, month, and decade.  Averaging is done for three
non-overlapping periods (1854-1909, 1910-1949, 1950-79) in an attempt
to separate possible climatic epochs or observational discontinuities.
Further smoothing is done for the resulting 216 sets of sextile
triplets (6 variables <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2865.xbm">  3 periods <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2865.xbm">  12 months).  The result is
three sets of smoothed lower and upper limits (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2869.xbm">)
around the smoothed mean (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2871.xbm">) for each variable, month, and 2°  
box.  These means and limits are used to create trimming bounds for
the variables.  A detailed description of the statistical process can
be found in Slutz <em>et al.</em>  (1985), section C.  Trimming flags for sea
surface temperature, air temperature, humidity, wind and sea level
pressure are included in CMR-5 for each observation.  Note that
trimming does not take into account different methods of observation
within the same period, nor were bias corrections applied when the limits
were generated.
<P>
We have used the COADS/CMR-5 flags to perform quality control on the
data used as input to our 1-degree statistics and analysis.
Table <A HREF=section3_3.html#tabqc>4</A> summarizes the possible values of the quality control
flags in COADS/CMR-5.  In general, an observation is rejected if it
differs from the smoothed median by more than 3.5 ``standard
deviations'' (flag value equal to 2) or the smoothed limits are not
available (flag value equal to -999).  However, over the regions
climatologically covered by sea ice, this trimming procedure still
yields very noisy fields.  This is due to the irregular coverage of
observations in ice-covered regions in both area and time.  In an
effort to generate
smoother fields in regions where sea ice is common, a more stringent
trimming criterion is used.  If an
observation occurs in a climatologically ice-covered
region, the observation is trimmed if it differs from the smoothed
median by more than 2.8 ``standard
deviations'' (flag value equal to 1 or 2).
