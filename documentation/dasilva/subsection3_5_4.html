Table <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#tabwmonths>6</A> summarizes the relationship between
measured/estimated wind
speed in COADS for different months when our correction is applied.
As expected, the best performance is attained for January, the base
month used to derive the scale.  The slopes of the least squares fit
lines are consistent throughout the year within 5%of 1.
<P>
Table <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#tabOWS>7</A> summarizes the performance of the UWM scale for 5
degree boxes around Ocean Weather Stations (OWS) in the North Pacific and
North Atlantic oceans.  For each month from 1970 to 1989, separate
monthly mean wind speeds are computed for measured and estimated wind
reports.  These boxes are chosen to include OWS so that a great
number of anemometer measured reports are present (although not all
OWS were reporting the entire period).  Monthly means
with fewer than 30 observations for a particular month are eliminated.
Note that no objective analysis is performed.  As before, the WI
flag in COADS CMR-5 was taken at face value, although H.-J. Isemer
(personal communication) has brought to our attention apparent
inconsistencies in this flag in the neighborhood of some OWS.  A
sensitivity test eliminating dubious WI reports has been conducted 
for some OWS and
the main conclusions of this section are not affected by this tighter
quality control.  The most striking feature in Table <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#tabOWS>7</A> is
the larger standard deviation (and scatter) compared to the
climatological results presented in the previous sections.  This
increase in standard deviation is partially due to the absence of
objective analysis, combined with the noisier character of monthly
mean, regional data.  In ten out of the 16 boxes near ocean weather
stations that were studied, the measured/estimated wind pairs have slopes 
within 10%of 1.  Biases are generally small, although a few boxes
(OWS B, E, N, and T) have biases in excess of 0.25 m/s.  As an
illustration of the results for a box in which the UWM Beaufort scale
has moderate performance,
Fig. <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#figowsp>4</A> depicts measured vs. estimated wind
speeds for the box around OWS P.

Figure <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#figwemglo>5</A> shows the global distribution of annual mean
measured and estimated winds.  Most of the large scale patterns of
measured/estimated winds match quite well, surprisingly even in the
data sparse regions of the southern oceans.

Figure <A HREF=subsection3_5_4.html#figptau>6</A> shows the performance of the UWM Beaufort
climatological scale on pseudo stress.
Our correction produces a consistent estimate of pseudo wind stress
with a slope about 0.98 and small bias.  However, there is a tendency to
underestimate annual mean pseudo wind stress above 175 m<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2891.xbm">/s<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2891.xbm">.
