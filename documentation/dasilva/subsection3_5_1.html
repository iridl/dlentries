Flag ``WI'' included in each COADS/CMR-5 wind observation is used to
discriminate measured from estimated wind speeds.  This flag takes
only two values: 1 for measured winds and 0 for winds estimated or
unknown.  It is conceivable that some of the observations flagged as
estimated/unknown could in fact be measured (see Cardone <em>et al.</em>  
[1990] for a discussion of problems with the measured/estimated
indicator in a similar data set).  In order to homogenize estimated
winds we found it necessary to bracket all COADS estimated wind speeds
according to the old WMO scale (Table <A HREF=subsection3_5_1.html#tabcodes>5</A>) and replace
them with the appropriate equivalent wind speeds. To have a
good balance between measured and estimated wind speed observations
 we restricted the analysis to the last two decades (1970-89).

In order to eliminate spatial and temporal noise due to inhomogeneous
sampling over the oceans, we have objectively analyzed our fields to
fill in gaps in data sparse regions and remove small scale noise.
Objective analysis is also effective in outlier removal, which is
beneficial to the regression analysis of section <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#secnewscale>5.3</A>.
Details of the objective analysis can be found in 
section <A HREF=section3_8.html#secanalysis>8</A> and Levitus (1982).
