Beginning in 1982, clear weather observations are often recorded with
a missing Present Weather indicator.  This practice has an adverse
effect on our precipitation estimates as it introduces a <em>wet</em> bias.
In order to circumvent this problem we have devised a method of correction
which links PW with cloudiness.  It is assumed that any observer making
a cloud cover observation will also make a PW observation, and vice
versa.  Therefore, when encountering a missing observation from 1982
and later observations, cloudiness is checked.  If cloudiness is
missing, PW is assumed to be missing, and is not included in the
precipitation calculation.  If a cloudiness observation is
present, however, it is assumed that there was a PW observation and that
the weather was clear.  The observation is used as a clear weather
observation in the precipitation calculation. As a test, PW
and cloudiness observations were checked prior to 1982.  Cases in
which a cloudiness observation was present but the PW
observation was missing were very rare.  We are confident, therefore,
that our method of correcting PW is accurate.
