The main objective of this section 
is to devise a correction to the Code 1100 Beaufort
equivalent scale that would bring not only average measured/estimated
wind speed in closer agreement, but also produce consistent 
mean estimates of nonlinear quantities
such as the average pseudo wind stress
(<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2931.xbm">). It would seem that a simple linear regression formula
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_equation328.xbm"><P>
would bring measured/estimated wind speeds in Fig. <A HREF=subsection3_5_2.html#figws4>2</A>a in close
agreement, as discussed in the previous section.
In the above formula
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2933.xbm"> and
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2935.xbm"> stand for the corrected and old WMO 
Code 1100 wind speed, respectively, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2937.xbm">, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2939.xbm"> 
constants to be determined.
However,
consistency between measured/estimated average pseudo wind stress
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2941.xbm"> requires not only the mean speeds to be consistent
(<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2943.xbm">), but also a consistency of standard deviations 
(<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2945.xbm">).  Such consistency
of standard deviations cannot be accomplished with a simple linear
regression. As mentioned earlier, a correction 
to the old WMO
scale should increase low wind speeds and decrease high wind speeds. 
After much experimentation it was determined that such correction can
be accomplished by a function of the form
<P><A NAME=eqcorr><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_equation338.xbm"><P>
All of the three alternative Beaufort equivalent scales of the last section 
can accurately be
expressed in the form of eq. (<A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#eqcorr>5</A>). The constants <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2937.xbm">,
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2939.xbm"> are determined by means of a least squares fit.
<P>
Figure <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#figws9>3</A> shows the results of these computations based on northern
hemisphere data, base years 1970-89.  Each ``row'' in this diagram
corresponds to a different set of constants <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2937.xbm">/<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2939.xbm">, and each
``column'' corresponds to test data for a particular period (annual,
January or July).  For example, the diagonal depicts estimated vs.
measured wind speeds with the corrected Beaufort equivalent scale
developed for that particular month.

It is clear from Figs. <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#figws9>3</A>a,d,g that any of the new Beaufort equivalent 
scales
performs better on climatological annual winds than the CMM-IV scale
(Fig. <A HREF=subsection3_5_2.html#figws4>2</A>b), the ``best'' among the current scales. The new January
scale (middle row) performs nearly as well on annual data as the
optimal annual scale,
with standard errors equal to 0.17 and 0.16 m/s, respectively (compare
Figs. <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#figws9>3</A>d and <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#figws9>3</A>a).  A close examination of
Fig. <A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#figws9>3</A> reveals that on
January/July data the January scale is slightly more accurate than the annual
scale.  The July scale only outperforms the annual/January scales on
the July data, but marginally so.  The seasonal dependence of the
scales is modest and does not warrant the use of a different scale
for each month.  Based on this analysis, and additional plots for
other oceans, we selected the January scale as our primary scale.  
In this case eq. (<A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#eqcorr>5</A>) reads:
<P><A NAME=eqjan><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_equation357.xbm"><P>
Notice that when this equation is applied to climatological winds 
the second term on
the right hand side (RHS) should be the average of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2957.xbm">,
(<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2959.xbm">) rather than the square-root of the average
wind, (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap2961.xbm">).
<P>
The wind speed correction given in eq. (<A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#eqjan>6</A>) can be used to
derive a revised Beaufort equivalent scale for use in COADS.  In
Table <A HREF=subsection3_5_1.html#tabcodes>5</A> the mean equivalent wind speed and respective
interval of wind speeds for the WMO Code 1100 scale have been mapped
using eq. (<A HREF=subsection3_5_3.html#eqjan>6</A>) to produce a new corrected scale.
Figure <A HREF=subsection3_5_2.html#figbars>1</A> depicts the difference between this corrected
scale and the other Beaufort equivalent scales.  Consistent with the
other scales, the UWM scale indicates that the old WMO Code 1100 scale
underestimates low wind speeds and overestimates high wind speeds.
However, the magnitude of the correction is generally smaller than
previous alternatives to the old WMO scale.
