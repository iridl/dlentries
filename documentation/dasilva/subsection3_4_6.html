A code number signifying the present weather conditions is recorded as a
standard part of a ship's observation.  This code can be used as a proxy for 
precipitation, as precipitation is rarely measured on ships.
Beginning in the early 1980's, the WMO no longer required Present Weather (PW)
to be recorded for clear weather observations (S. Woodruff, personal
communication).  Previously, in clear
weather episodes, the observer entered a code number indicating there
was no weather observed.  When the observations in the 1980's were
entered into the COADS interim product, the missing clear weather observations
were given the missing flag, just as truly missing PW observations were.
Using such observations as they are recorded in COADS would eliminate
most if not all clear weather (rainless and snowless) reports.  If few
clear weather reports are available, the result would be a wet 
bias in the 1980's precipitation.  This effect would be particularly evident
in climatologically clear areas, such as below the subtropical highs.
In the course of this investigation, it was discovered that there is
indeed a sharp increase in the number of missing PW observations
beginning in 1982.
