Biases in dew point temperature are generally associated with
contamination of the wet bulb thermometer by salt or insufficient
moistening of the wet bulb thermometer wick.  These instrumentation
problems lead to a systematically higher value of the specific
humidity.  On average, the dew point temperature is biased about
0.5° C (Isemer and Hasse 1987 and references within).  Since this
bias is due mainly to human errors for which no record is available,
it is very difficult to devise a correction.

Kent <em>et al.</em> (1993a) have found that dew point temperature measured by
psychrometers were on average lower than those reported from 
ships using
screens. By considering the many factors that might have contributed to
this discrepancy, Kent <em>et al.</em> (1993a) concluded that psychrometer
observations were more reliable and a simple regression equation was
devised to correct screen-measured dew point temperatures. Because of
inadequate metadata in COADS/CMR-5 (there is no indicator of the 
method of measurement for dew point temperature) this correction
could not be implemented at the present time.
