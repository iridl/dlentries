Because wind is a key parameter for the determination of the air-sea
fluxes at the ocean surface, a great deal of effort has been devoted
to sort out the problems with ship winds.  Wind speeds reported by
ships are either directly measured with anemometers or are
estimated from the <em>sea state</em>.  Instrumentation problems with
anemometers are believed (or better, assumed) to be non-systematic and
are expected to cancel out when spatial/temporal averages are taken.
Estimated winds are somewhat subjective and depend on the skill of the
observer.  But even when a correct identification of the sea state is
made, it still needs to be converted to wind speed through a Beaufort
equivalent scale.
<P>
Since 1946, a Beaufort equivalent scale developed by Simpson (1906),
combined with a well defined sea state devised by Petersen (1927), has been
used by meteorological weather services (Roll 1965; Isemer and Hasse
1991).  This scale is known as Code 1100 and is sometimes referred to
as the <em>old</em> WMO scale.  It is now widely accepted that the old
WMO Beaufort equivalent scale results in systematic biases when
compared to anemometer measured winds.
There are a few alternative Beaufort equivalent scales (WMO 1970;
Cardone 1969; Kaufeld 1981), and they all suggest
that the old WMO scale underestimates the winds for Beaufort numbers
less than about 6 and overestimates winds for Beaufort numbers greater
than about 6.  As pointed out by Isemer and Hasse (1991), this
systematic error causes climatological wind speeds to be
underestimated, and climatological wind speed standard deviation to be
overestimated in the North Atlantic Ocean. Concerning long term
variability, Cardone <em>et al.</em>  (1990) have shown that a Beaufort scale
correction, ship anemometer height adjustment, and stability
correction strongly reduce artificial trends in wind speed, and
drastically improve the agreement between measured and estimated
winds.
<P>
Finally, most definitions of transfer coefficients are
calibrated to work with winds from a reference level of 10 m above the
ocean surface.  Cardone <em>et al.</em>   (1990) suggest that the average ship
anemometer height is actually 20 m. Kent <em>et al.</em>  (1993a) shows that
during VSOP-NA a typical anemometer height is in the range
15-20 m, but on modern container ships the anemometer heights are
about 30 m. 
A common approximation is to take
the 20 m wind in place of the required 10 m.  Since virtually all ship
anemometers are higher than 10 m, this approximation introduces a
systematic error.  Isemer and Hasse (1991) estimated that the 10 m wind
speed is on average 93%of the wind speed at 20 m.  Calculations by
the authors show that for light winds under stable conditions, the
surface layer has strong shear and the wind at 10 m can be as low as
40%of the wind speed at 20 m.  This result suggests that a careful
stability dependent correction is warranted.
<P>
The ship type indicator, however, is often incorrect or missing
in COADS/CMR-5.  This is particularly significant in the
1980's when large numbers of drifting buoys were placed in the
southern oceans.  We have found that nearly all buoy observations in
the COADS/CMR-5 1980's interim product are not identified correctly.
The result is that a wind observation measured at 5 m is treated as if
it were taken at 20 m.  Winds in regions sampled mainly by drifting
buoys will be biased toward lower values. This problem has 
apparently been fixed in
COADS Release 1A and the correct identification of buoys will be
included in future analyses.
