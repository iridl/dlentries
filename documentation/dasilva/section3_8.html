The raw monthly fields are computed from the individual observations 
in the following manner:
<OL><LI> The world oceans are divided into boxes with constant grid spacing
in latitude and longitude.  The grid we consider here is 1-degree
latitude by 1-degree longitude (the same as Levitus [1982]).
<P>
<LI> All available (quality controlled) observations are averaged in
each box for each month during the 45 year period, and the standard
deviation and number of observations recorded.  Bias corrections, if
applicable, are made to each individual observation before averaging.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
The raw monthly mean fields are then objectively analyzed to filter out
spatial noise and interpolate to gridpoints where data are missing.
The objective analysis scheme used is essentially the same scheme described by 
Levitus (1982).
This is an iterative
difference-correction scheme (Cressman 1959) with a weight function developed
by Barnes (1964).  The procedure can be summarized as follows:
<OL><LI> Determine a first guess <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3477.xbm"> (see below).
<LI> Compute the difference between the raw observed data (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3475.xbm">) and the
first guess (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3477.xbm">), 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3479.xbm"> 
at grid point (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3501.xbm">).
<LI> Compute the smoothed analysis increments
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_equation703.xbm"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3483.xbm"> is the Barnes weight function:
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3485.xbm"> for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3487.xbm"> where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3489.xbm"> is the distance between
the <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3491.xbm">th gridpoint <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3493.xbm"> and the analysis 
gridpoint <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3495.xbm">. The sum
on the RHS is over the region of influence, i.e., those points that are at
a distance less than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3497.xbm">, the radius of influence.
<LI> Update the first guess
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_equation712.xbm"><P>
<LI> Apply a 5-point nonlinear median filter to <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3499.xbm"> (Beaton and
Tukey 1974; Rabiner <em>et al.</em>  1975) followed by two passes of a 5-point
linear filter (Shapiro 1970).  It was found that this combination effectively
filters out noise with scales of the mesh-size.  The two filters are
applied as follows:
<OL><LI>  Non-linear.  The smoothed value at the grid point (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3501.xbm">) is simply 
the <em>median</em>
value of the nine grid points in the 3 by 3 box centered at the grid point 
(<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3501.xbm">).  The filter is not applied to grid points located over or adjacent to
land.  The
median filter is used to remove noise from the data while preserving 
sharp gradients (Reynolds 1988; Rabiner <em>et al.</em>  1975).
<LI>  Linear.   The smoothed value <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3505.xbm"> at grid point (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3501.xbm">) of
a grid <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3509.xbm"> is
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_eqnarray*721.xbm"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3511.xbm"> is a smoothing parameter.  Two passes of
the Shapiro filter are performed with <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3513.xbm"> for the
first pass and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3515.xbm"> for the second pass. The second pass is
intended to restore the amplitude of the large scales which were
slightly damped in the first pass (Shapiro 1970).
The filter is not applied to the grid point if it is located 
over land or if any of the four adjacent grid points (north, south,
east, and west) are located over land.
</OL>
<P>
<LI> Repeat steps 2-5 with a different radius of influence <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_tex2html_wrap3517.xbm">.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
The radius of influence is decreased with each pass in order to
analyze smaller scale features with each successive iteration (Cressman 1959).
In practice, the smallest wavelengths are noisy.
Therefore, the smallest radius of influence needs to be at least seven to
eight times the average separation distance (Levitus 1982).  The smallest
radius of influence we use, 771 km, is over seven times the average
separation distance of a 1- by 1-degree grid.
<P>
For climatologies and anomalies, 4 passes of the analysis scheme are
performed with radii of influence equal to 1541 km, 1211 km, 881 km,
and 771 km, as in Levitus (1982).  These radii correspond to 14°,
11°, 8°, and 7°  in latitude and longitude at the Equator.
At 60°  latitude North or South, the radii correspond to 28°,
22°, 16°, and 14°  longitude.  Below 40° S only the first
two passes of the analysis are used in an effort to smooth the noisy
data in these latitudes.  The standard deviation and standard error
fields are also noisy.  In order to smooth them sufficiently, only two
passes of the analysis are applied to those fields, using the two
largest radii.
<P>
<P><A NAME=tabresponse><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_770_table734.gif"><P>
<P>
The response function for the objective analysis using four passes
with radii of 1541, 1211, 881, and 771 km, but without any linear or
nonlinear filter, is given in the second column of
Table <A HREF=section3_8.html#tabresponse>10</A> (from Levitus 1982).  As expected, the short
wavelengths are damped severely while the intermediate and longer
wavelengths receive moderate and little damping, respectively.
Table <A HREF=section3_8.html#tabresponse>10</A> also shows the response function of the
analysis
including the linear filter, for both four passes and two passes of
the analysis.  Notice that the damping is much greater for all but the
smallest wavelengths with two passes of the analysis compared to that
with four passes.  For extremely long wavelengths (not shown), the
damping from two passes of the analysis is nearly identical to the
damping from four passes.
<P>
Finally, the first guess for the analysis depends on the kind of data
being analyzed:
<P>
<DL ><DT>Annual Mean Climatology:
<DD> <BR>Individual raw monthly means are averaged to
produce the raw monthly mean climatologies.  These monthly
climatologies are averaged to produce the raw annual climatology.  The
first guess for the annual climatology analysis is the zonal average
for the individual ocean basins, following Levitus (1982).
<P>
<DT>Monthly Mean Climatologies:
<DD> <BR>The first guess for the analysis 
of a raw monthly
climatology is the analyzed annual mean climatology.
<P>
<DT>Monthly Mean Anomalies:
<DD> <BR>From the observed 
raw monthly mean fields, the
monthly mean analyzed climatology is subtracted to produce observed
<em>raw</em> anomalies.  A zero field is used as first guess in the
analysis scheme.
<P>
<DT>Monthly Standard Deviation/Error:
<DD><BR>The first guess 
for the analysis of
the raw monthly standard deviation or standard error is the zonal average for
the individual ocean basins.
