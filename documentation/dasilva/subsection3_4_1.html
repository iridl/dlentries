Biases in sea surface temperature are associated with different
methods of measurements (basically <em>bucket</em> and <em>intake</em>),
which also respond in different ways to atmospheric conditions.  On
average, measurement with an uninsulated canvas bucket introduces an
error of about 0.5° C due to evaporative cooling.  Folland and
Hsiung (1986) [see also Folland 1991] have developed a physical model
for a typical canvas bucket that predicts the amount of evaporative
cooling as a function of the atmospheric conditions and exposure time
of the bucket.  This model has been used effectively to correct the
bias in bucket observations (Farmer <em>et al.</em>  1989).  However,
Farmer <em>et al.</em>  (1989) have used the bucket correction
method only for pre-World War II observations.  Observations after
that time were assumed to be almost exclusively measured by intake
or by insulated buckets.
This is consistent with the fact that the largest
discontinuity in SST due to changes in measurement procedure
(approximately one-half degree rise in SST around 1940) took place prior
to our analysis period (Bottomley <em>et al.</em>  1990, Kushnir 1994).
<P>
Recently, the <em>Voluntary Observing Ships Special Observing Program
for the North Atlantic</em> (VSOP-NA, Kent <em>et al.</em>  1993a) has found that
observations of SST from insulated buckets and hull contact sensors are
reliable. A constant bias of 0.35° C was found in observations from
ships' intake thermometers compared to those measured by bucket.
<P>
The unreliability of the bucket/intake
indicator in COADS and the lack of reliable information about the kind
of bucket used make this correction impractical from individual
observations.  Therefore, we do not include a sea surface temperature
correction in this version of our calculations.
