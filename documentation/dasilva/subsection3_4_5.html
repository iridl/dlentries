Cloudiness observations on board ships are estimated visually.
In very low light conditions, observers often miss high level clouds.
This tends to bias night time cloudiness toward a smaller fraction of
cloud cover (Sverdrup 1933; Riehl 1947; Schneider <em>et al.</em>  1989).  It is 
possible to reduce this bias by rejecting cloudiness observations
taken during dark sky conditions.  These conditions can be determined
by the altitude of the sun and the phase and altitude of the moon.
<P>
Another bias in cloudiness results from <em>sky obscured</em>
observations.  A sky obscured observation means that clouds are not
visible due to smoke, blowing dust, fog, snow, or some other
phenomenon.  This condition represents over 6%of the observations in
the period 1952-81 (Hahn <em>et al.</em> 1992).  Sky obscured observations are coded
separately and cannot be assigned one cloudiness value, as not all sky
obscuring phenomena are associated with clouds.  But if none of these
observations are included, heavy fog- or snow-associated cloudiness
would be eliminated and the cloudiness would be biased toward a lower
value.  To eliminate this bias, the <em>present weather</em> code can be
checked for each sky obscured observation (see section <A HREF=subsection3_6_2.html#seccloudcorr>6.2</A>).
