  <body><h1>April-June 1994</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>

During April, May and June 1994 the following features were noticeable:
<ul>
<li>Surface winds were strongest [more than 10 m/s] in the Indian Ocean, 
particularly during June, when a strong  south-west monsoon was established..   
The anticyclonic circulation centered around 30N, 30W in the Northern Atlantic
is still dominant.  During the same period the sea level pressure remained above
average over the Australian continent, leading to rainfall deficiency, 
particularly to the South.


<li>The clustering and stalling of the drifting buoys continued in the northern 
Atlantic, in the vicinity of the center of the Anticyclonic circulation.

<li>The SOI stayed negative during the period [between -1 and -2], consistent with 
positive SSTA [+1.0 C] in the subtropical central and eastern Pacific in June.

<li>Mean wave heights above 4m appeared in the Indian Ocean during June [Arabian Sea
and up to 5m around 40S and 80E].

<li>It is worth noticing that the thermocline depth in the equatorial Pacific 
remained more or less near normal, while heat storage anomalies up to 0.5E9 
J/m2 were found in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean ITCZ and Pacific SPCZ.
</ul>

Observations and analyses indicate lingering El-Nino conditions in the Pacific. 
This could contribute to a suppressed Hurricane season in the Atlantic during  
Summer  1994.
