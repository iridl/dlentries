    <h1>October-December 1996</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>

During October, November and December of 1996, the following features were 
noticeable:
<ul>
<li>
In a narrow band north of the equatorial Pacific drifting buoys are moving quite
fast in the vicinity of a well defined NECC. On the contrary buoys are stalled 
in the Gulf of Alaska (November).
<li>
The SOI remained positive ( 0.8 in December). This is associated with easterly 
anomalies of the trades over the central and eastern Pacific and westerly 
anomalies from the eastern Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent.  Over these 
regions the convective activity is extremely intense. The intra-seasonal 
oscillation picked up during November and December. Over the northern Atlantic 
the NAO is reversed during December bringing cold air over western Europe and 
lots of precipitation over Spain and the Mediterranean basin.
<li>
Negative SST anomalies (-0.3° C to -0.8° C) are found east of the dateline in 
the Nino 3 area. Positive SSTA are found in the Kuroshio Extension and west of 
170° E (+0.5° C) and along the SPCZ.  At 60°S  except in the Pacific the SST is 
1°C above normal. The warmest parts of the Atlantic ocean in December are found 
at 40°N and 40°S at 40°W. The SSTA in the eastern Atlantic Ocean are above 
normal around 40° N. Subsurface temperature in the central and eastern 
equatorial Pacific Ocean are below normal. 
<li>
The thermocline is extremely deep in the western Pacific during December 
(deepest levels of the last ten years) with sea level pressure corrected 
anomalies up to 16 cm.
 </ul>
The above conditions are associated with a slight intensification of a cold 
episode in the Pacific Ocean. The Walker circulation has been accordingly 
reinforced.
