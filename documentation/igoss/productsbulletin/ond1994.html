  <body><h1>October-December 1994</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
During October, November and December of 1994, the following features were 
noticeable:
<ul>
<li>There was very high SLP over Indonesia and Australia conducive of rainfall 
deficit and droughts in those regions. A strong atmospheric anticyclonic 
circulation is present in the northern Pacific with a reversed PNA pattern in 
November. Winds larger than 10m/s were found during December in the northern 
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as in the Southern Oceans between Tasmania 
and  Antarctica.

<li>The longest trajectories of the drifting buoys were  found in the Pacific 
section of the circumpolar current as well as off the Japanese coastline and 
around 20!N and 150!W [December].
 
<li>The SOI was strongly negative during the entire period and for the 8th 
consecutive month. Weak easterlies were found near the dateline with westerly 
anomalies larger than 8m/s and actual westerlies during November.

<li>Mean wave height above 5m were found In the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
[December]. Values over 4m were associated with the circumpolar current 
particularly south of Australia.

<li> SST anomalies [larger than 2C] appear at the Equator between the dateline and 
160W.  Actual temperatures greater than 30C are found also near the dateline. 
Large SST anomalies dissipated in the northern Atlantic Ocean while they 
appeared in the northern Pacific at 35N between 150W and 175W [
      December].

<li>The thermocline depth increased in the central and eastern Pacific. The 20C 
isotherm is found 50m deeper between 120!W and the dateline. Warm heat storage 
in the upper 400m is found in the eastern equatorial Pacific as well as the 
central Indian Oceans.   The equatorial sea-level anomaly was positive on the 
Equator at the dateline during Fall [+4cm] the largest anomalies of  +8cm and 
-8cm being located in the central and eastern Indian Ocean respectively.  
Negative values of -8cm were found at 150W and 12N and positive values of +8cm
off the coast of Japan.

</ul>
The December oceanic conditions reflect the matured  warm phase of ENSO, with 
the global heat storage anomalies consistent with the canonical  pattern 
determined by Tourre and  White [to appear in JPO, June 1995].
