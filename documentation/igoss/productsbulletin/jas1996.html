    <h1>July-September 1996</h1>

<h2>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
During July, August and September of 1996, the following features were 
noticeable:

Above normal temperatures in the western US and below normal temperatures in the
northeast US. Humid and cool conditions continue to dominate in that region 
while drought conditions persisted in the southwest. High temperatures are also 
found in northeast Africa, the Caribbean Indonesia and southern Argentina. In 
the meantime low temperatures are over Europe and Siberia. 
<p>
In a narrow band straddling the equatorial Pacific drifting buoys are moving 
quite fast. Long trajectories are also found in the northwest Pacific Ocean.
 <p>
The SOI remained positive (0.5 to 0.7) since January after having been negative 
for nearly 5 years. This is associated with weakly above average trades over the
Pacific and above average typhoon activity in the northwest Pacific Ocean. SST 
above 30°C are found in the western equatorial Pacific during September.

Maximum sea level anomalies (above 10 cm, atmospheric pressure corrected) are 
found east of New Guinea.
<p>
Weak negative SST anomalies (-0.3°C to -0.5°C) are found east of the dateline.
Maximum positive SSTA are found in the Japan Sea(+1°C), and west of 160°E (0.5°
C).  The SSTA in the eastern Atlantic Ocean are above normal around 40°N. 
Negative values are located in the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio areas 
(September). The SST in the southern Atlantic Ocean (south of 20°S) are below 
normal.

<p>
Subsurface temperature in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean are 
below normal. 

 
The above conditions are associated with a weak cold episode in the Pacific 
Ocean which should persist until at least the end of 1996.
