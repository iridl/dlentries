  <body><h1>July-September 1994</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
During July, August and September 1994, the following features were noticeable:
<ul>
<li>There was a strong summer monsoon circulation over the Indian Ocean during July 
and August.  A maximum pseudo-stress anomaly of 80m2  s-2 occurred during August
10S and 60E.  The anti-cyclonic circulation in the northern Pacific and 
Atlantic oceans were well established during July.  Winds larger than 10m s-1 
were found during the entire period at 50S from the tip of South Africa to 
120oE.

<li>The longest trajectories of the drifting buoys were  found at 50oS between 30E 
and 90E.

<li>The SOI was strongly negative during the entire period [-1.8] and for the 5th 
consecutive month.

<li>Mean wave height above 4.5m were found between 30S and 60S and from 30E to 
150E during July and August.  Values larger than 5m  were found during August 
south of Tasmania.

<li>A patch of SST anomalies [larger than 1C] not only persists at the Equator and 
the dateline but extends northeastward during September.  Large SST anomalies 
were also found at 40N in the northwest Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.    It is 
noteworthy that the southern oceans are also anomalously warm during September. 
The coldest sea-surface temperature was located where the "warm pool" is usually
found, and also  in the southwest Pacific.

<li>The thermocline deepened in the central and eastern Pacific.   The sea-level 
anomaly was positive on the Equator at the dateline during September [+8cm].  
Negative values were found in the eastern equatorial Pacific and at 10N and 
150W.
</ul>
A continuation of  the Pacific warm condition combined with the anomalous 
pattern described above could lead to the formation of a  full-fledged  warm  
ENSO episode.
