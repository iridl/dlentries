<h1>Editor's Note</h1>

<p>This is the first Electronic version of the quarterly <a
href="http://www.unesco.org/ioc/igoss/HOME.HTML">IGOSS</a> Products
Bulletin [E-IPB].  IGOSS is a joint working committee between the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (<a
href="http://www.unesco.org/ioc/">IOC</a>) and the World Meterological
Organization (<a href="http://www.wmo.ch/">WMO</a>).  Its continuing
evolution is being implemented at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
[<a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu">LDEO</a>] of Columbia
University, in response to the needs of the oceanographic and earth
science communities for real-time Oceanography.  The format of the
global analyses is standardized.  In addition, the different data sets
have been made available at grid points. This will allow users to
edit, contour and compute their preferred indices at diverse
locations.

<p>This new format assures that accurate data-sets are
made available in a timely fashion. It fully supports programs
and service-systems such as the Global Ocean Observing System
[<a href="http://www.unesco.org/ioc/goos/iocgoos.htm">GOOS</a>], the Global
    Climate Observing System [<a href="http://www.wmo.ch/web/gcos/gcoshome.html">GCOS</a>], the Climate
Variability Program [<a href="http://www.dkrz.de/clivar/hp.html">CLIVAR</a>], and the newly begun Global Ocean
Atmosphere Land System [GOALS].

<p>The "Bundesamt f&uuml;r Seeschiffart und Hydrographie"
[BSH] in Hamburg, will continue to print and distribute  the
hard-copy version of the IPB, worldwide. We hope that the
electronic version will be a useful tool for our community. The
Internet addresses of the different analysts and national
services involved in the IPB are included to ease communications
between users and servers.

<p>Our thanks are directed to Dr. Benno Blumenthal at
LDEO, whose collaboration in the making of the E-IPB is deeply
appreciated.
