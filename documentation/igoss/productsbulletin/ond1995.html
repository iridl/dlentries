    <h1>October-December 1995</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
During October, November and December of 1995, the following features were
noticeable:
<ul>
<li>Dry conditions over northeast China in October while the warm spell over
southeast Africa ended abruptly. Wet weather dominated over eastern US, western
Europe was mild (October, November).

<li>In the northern Atlantic drifting buoys continued being caught in small scales
oceanic eddies (November, December), the longest trajectories being found at
15°N between 120°E and 150°E. During December long trajectories were also found
between 5°N-5°S east of 150°W. This is also the area where the easterlies
picked-up.
 
<li>The SOI is slightly near zero during October and November.

<li>Sea level anomalies (pressure corrected) were 10 cm above normal at 15°S between
170°E and 170°W.

<li>Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) were above normal in the North Pacific,
with 1°C anomalies along the US west coast and from the sea of Okhotsk to the
Kamchatka peninsula. Negative SSTA were present in the Ni&ntilde;o 3 and Ni&ntilde;o 4 regions
which continued the trend of the last period.

<li>Positive SSTA persisted in the western and subtropical Atlantic. Positive SSTA
in the path of African easterly waves contributed to a very active Hurricane
activity in the Atlantic (Gray et al., Wea. Forecasting, 1993a and b). 19
tropical storms and 11 hurricanes were counted at the end of October. These were
the second largest numbers since 1886!
Typhoon Zack and super Typhoon Angela were extremely destructive over Vietnam
and the Philippines. Heavy rain returned to Indonesia.

<li>At the end of the period the largest negative SSTA are found in the central
north Pacific around 40°N and the southwestern southern Atlantic around 50°S.
The SST along the eastern USA  is colder than normal.

<li>The thermocline continue to get deeper (+20m) in the western equatorial Pacific
west of 170°E) and shallower (-40m) around 130°W and the equator during
November.

All of the above conditions clearly described a weak La Ni&ntilde;a period, in spite of
a still slightly negative SOI during December. An important feature is the
persistence of the SSTA in the northern subtropical and eastern Atlantic which
could be associated with low frequency gyre variability there.
