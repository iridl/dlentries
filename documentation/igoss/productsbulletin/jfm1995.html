    <h1>January-March 1995</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>

During January, February and March of 1995, the following features were 
noticeable:
<ul>
<li>A blocking high persisted in the troposphere over Alaska from the end of  
February until the end of  March. The previously well organized cyclonic 
circulation in the vicinity of the Aleutians became much weaker during March. 
<li>
The longest trajectories of the drifting buoys were found in the western 
equatorial Pacific as well as in the northern Atlantic where the westerlies were
quite strong.
<li>
The SOI which had been negative for the 10 consecutive months became positive in
March. North easterlies were well established in the tropical Pacific while 
easterly anomalies appeared at the end of the period in the eastern Pacific. 
Westerlies persisted at 50°S, in the southern Indian Ocean and south of 
Australia. Strong westerlies were evident between 50°N and 60°N in the northern 
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
<li>
Mean wave height above 4.5m were found between 40°N and 60°N again in the 
northern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.
<li>
Positive SSTA (+ 1°C) persisted in the central Pacific Ocean while negative 
anomalies appeared in the eastern Pacific during March. During the same month 
negative SSTA prevailed in the north Pacific around 30°N.

<li>
Cold heat storage in the upper 400m (HS 400) is now found along the equatorial 
Pacific. During March warmer HS 400 appeared in the western Indian Ocean as well
as the northern Atlantic Ocean.  these are classic conditions of an anti El Nino
period. This is well demonstrated in movies available on the World Wide Web at 
<a href="http://cyberia.ucsd.edu/WARREN/">http://cyberia.ucsd.edu/WARREN/</a>. An homogeneous pressure corrected sea-level 
pressure anomaly (over 5 cm) appeared in February and lasted in march at 10°S 
and around the dateline.

The March oceanic conditions reflect the end of the matured  warm phase of the 
global ENSO signal. Warm oceanic conditions are to be expected during the year 
in the western tropical and northern  Atlantic Ocean (Lau and Nath, 1994, J. 
Climate, 7, 1184-1207; Tourre and White, 1995, JPO, 25, 1317-1332).
