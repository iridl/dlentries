  <body><h1>January-March 1994</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>

During January,  February and March 1994, the
following features were noticeable:

<p>
Surface winds were strongest [more than 10 m/s] in
the Southern  Oceans  between 50S and 60S, as well as in the
northern Atlantic between 40N and 60N where strong
anticyclonic circulation was present.  In the tropical Pacific
the easterlies increased in January and February, the SPCZ 
being displaced south-westward.    The Australian monsoon was
very active during February.
<ul>

<li>	The clustering of  the drifting buoys around 30N
persisted in the Atlantic during January and February.

<li>	A negative PNA took place in February, the SOI being 
near zero or slightly negative during the period.

<li>	Equatorial  SSTA were slightly positive in the
western Pacific and near zero in the eastern Pacific.  The
southeast sector of the Warm Pool was colder than normal in
March. The coldest  SST were found south of Greenland during
March.

<li>	During February and March the depth of the equatorial
Pacific thermocline was near normal in the west and slightly
shallower in the east.   

<li>	Positive heat storage anomalies were found in  the
Pacific and north-Atlantic subtropical gyres.   Negative
anomalies were found along the Pacific and Atlantic ITCZ.

</ul>
In this issue,  we resume the publication of  the SST
in the tropical Atlantic from France's Opera model.
