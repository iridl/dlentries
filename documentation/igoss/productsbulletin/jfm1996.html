    <h1>January-March 1996</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
During January and February of 1996, the following features were noticeable:
<ul>
<li>Southeast Africa  (Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia, Natal and Transvaal) southeast
Brazil  and western Madagascar were extremely wet. Wet and cold weather
dominated over eastern US, while wet conditions also prevailed over northern
California, southwest Oregon and central Washington. Southwestern Europe and
northwestern Africa were warm and wet.
<li>
In the northern Atlantic drifting buoys are still caught in small scales oceanic
eddies. The longest trajectories are found at 5°S all along the Pacific ocean
and along the circumpolar current.
 <li>
The SOI is slightly positive (anomalies still below those of May 1990). Easterly
are well established over the central Pacific with positive anomalies there.

<li>
Sea level anomalies (pressure corrected) are building up west of the dateline.
<li>
Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) were above normal northeast and
southwest of Australia. The Australian monsoon could nevertheless be classified
as moderate. Two tropical cyclones (Doloresse and Flossy) formed in the Indian
ocean. The subtropical southern Atlantic is warmer than normal.
Negative SSTA (-1°C) were found around 155°W during January and expanded at the
equator from 130°W to the dateline during February.

The thermocline continued to deepen in the western and central Pacific (-20 m),
the zero-line anomaly being located around 150°W and the equator.

The above conditions in the Pacific can be associated with weak La Ni&ntilde;a period.
This is particularly true for the in-phase negative SSTA anomalies at 35°N and
in the central and eastern Equatorial Pacific. It is also remarkable to note
that the entire tropical Atlantic is warmer than normal and positive SSTA are
also present at the southern tip of south Africa.
