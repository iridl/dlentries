  <body><h1>July-September 1993</h1>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
During July, August and September 1993, the following features were
    noticeable:<p>
Surface winds were still strongest (more than 10 m/s) at 50S in the
    southern Indian Ocean and south of Austrialia.  A well defined
    Anticyclonic circulation, associated with "blocking action", is
    seen in the northern Atlantic in September.
<ul>
<li> The longest drifting buoys trajectories are found at 60S.  A
      "cluster" of near stationary buoys is found in the vicinity of
the Anticyclonic center defined above.
<li> Mean wave height  greater than 4.5m are found in the southern
      hemisphere at 50S, while mean wave height greater than 3m are
      located south of the Labrador Sea and east of the Canadian
      trough which persisted in July and August.
<li> The negative values of the SOI mentioned in the previous Bulletin
      persisted [ -1.0; -1.5; -0.7] even if SLP at bouth Darwin and
      Tahiti were above normal in August and September.  Weak
      easterlies were found over the eastern tropical Pacific in
      September.
<li>  SSTA started to decrease in the eastern and central equatorial
      Pacific during July and August.  However, a 0.5C anomaly
      appeared in the central equatorial Pacific during the last
      month.  Accordingly convective activity increased near the date
      line. 
<li> The east Australian current and the Kuroshio Current and
      Extension remained anomalously cool.
<li>  Average sub-surface temperature anomaly [0/400m] are positive in
      the west Pacific and near the center of the north Atlantic gyre.
      The thermocline has deepened in the central equatorial Pacific
      near 140W, with evidence of easterly propagation during September.
</ul>
While ENSO presented some signs of "relief" last June, the even
    continued well into the Summer.  Atmospheric El-Ni&ntilde;o like
    conditions re-developed near the date line in September with, in
    particular, a well formed sub-tropical jet.  Blocking action over
    the northern Atlantic was present.
<p>
In this issue, the new analysis of the TOPEX-POSEIDON data (sea level
    deviation) is displayed.  The ERS-1 blended analysis is resumed.
    We also include the quarterly mean SST and winds from the TOGA-TOA
    array in the equatorial Pacific.  A new SST analysis in the
    tropical Atlantic from the "OPERA" numerical model is also
    displayed.
