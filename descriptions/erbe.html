<H2>I.  INTRODUCTION</H2>

This document describes a set of abbreviated, monthly averaged results 
of shortwave Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) and Atmospheric Radiation Budget 
(ARB), i.e. the shortwave radiative fluxes absorbed at the surface and in the
atmosphere. They are derived from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)
data set S-4 and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
analysis archive using the algorithm proposed by Li et al (1993). There are
three input parameters: reflected flux or albedo on the top of the atmosphere,
vertically integrated water vapor content and the solar zenith angle.
S-4 data provides monthly-mean reflected fluxes and albedo on the top
of the atmosphere at 2.5X2.5 degrees of latitude/longitude. Precipitable
water is obtained from ECMWF data by vertical integration of humidity
analyses from the bottom to the top of the atmosphere. Solar zenith angle
is calculated according to latitude and time. <P>

The ERBE consists of 3 satellites, NOAA 9, 10 and ERBS.  NOAA 
satellites were in sun-synchronous polar orbits, while ERBS has an
orbit inclined 57 degrees relative to the equator which allows
observations at different local times. ERBE has both scanning
and non-scanning radiometers.  Gridded product at 2.5X2.5 degrees was 
derived from scaner observations.  ERBS scaner began observation in
Nov. 1984 and failed in February 1990.  NOAA 9 scanner operated from
Jan 1985 to Jan 1987, while NOAA 10 from Oct 1986 to May 1989. 
The period covered by the S-4 product is not exactly same as the 
scanner operation time but a bit shorter. 
S-4 product contains both single data measured from one satellite and 
combined data from more than one satellites.  The principle of data 
selection in the acquisition of SRB and ARB is that single data were
not used unless combined data were not available. <P>

<OL>
<LI> GLOB/PART
    The files under directory GLOB differ from those under PART in
<OL>
<LI> GLOB files cover the whole globe, i.e. 90S to 90N, while PART files
    cover the region from 60S to 60N.
<LI> GLOB files are 4-year results (1985 - 1988), while PART files
    are nominally 5 years (1985-1989), except for January and July 
    for which PART files contains 4 years of results.                   

<LI> The results of 1989 contained in PART files are derived mainly from 
    ERBS observations, as the NOAA scanner failed thereafter. The results
    in polar region (60 north or south) contained in GLOB files are based on
    NOAA ERBE observations only, as the ERBS satellite cannot view these areas.
</OL>


<LI> SRB/ARB
    Files under SRB are shortwave surface radiation budget data, while those
    under ARB are shortwave radiation budget in the atmosphere.


<LI> MONTH/MEAN
<DL COMPACT>
<DT> MONTH
<DD> contains the results for individual months and years under all-sky
    condition.

<DT>  MEAN
<DD>  contains multi-year means of the monthly results that are obtained by
    averaging the results of the same months from 4 or 5 years of SRB or ARB 
    data.
</DL>   


<LI>   CLR/CLD/FOR
    MEAN has three sub-directories that contain clear-sky results (CLR),
    all-sky results (CLD) and cloud forcing (FOR) which is defined as the 
    difference between all-sky and clear-sky results.
