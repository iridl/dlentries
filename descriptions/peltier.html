<h1>Ice Age Paleotopography</h1>
W. Richard Peltier<p>

A gravitationally self-consistent theory of postglacial relative sea
level change is used to infer the variation of surface ice and water
cover since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).  The results show that LGM
ice volume was approximately 35 percent lower than suggested by the
CLIMAP reconstruction and the maximum heights of the main Laurentian
and Fennoscandian ice complexes are inferred to have been
commensurately lower with respect to sea level.  Use of these Ice Age
boundary conditions in atmospheric general circulation models will
yield climates than differ significantly from those previously
inferred on the basis of the CLIMAP data set.

provided here include topography/bathymetry and ice flags. 

<h2>Note</h2>
   In some areas, the ice-cover data indicates that there is ice
        while the topographic height is negative indicating that the
        region is below sealevel. In these cases, it should be assumed
        that the area is ice-covered. Either the region is not inundated
        or the ice is floating.
