<h2> New Data Product as of January 1995 </h2> 
<P>
    The Climate Analysis Center discontinued the SST product we'd
    been using and offered an optimum interpolation product in its
    place.  The new product (<a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IGOSS/.nmc/.monthly/">NMC Monthly</a>) has been
    computed over all ocean areas on a 1x1 degree grid and extends back
    to November 1981. For details on the new product, see the
<a
      href="http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/igoss/productsbulletin/descriptions/reynolds.html">NMC Monthly Documentation</a>.
<P>
    We chose to combine our original data and this new product as
    follows.  We retained our CAC data from Jan 1970 through Oct 1981
    and and then regridded the new product to match the old 2x2 grid
    from Nov 1981 through the present.  A new climatology was
    computed for the period Jan 1970 through December 1985 and then
    used to recompute all the anomalies for the entire period.  All
    other procedures (i.e. smoothing) were kept the same.
