<h2>BRIEF</h2>
This data set contains climatological monthly means of heat fluxes and
radiation budget over the global oceans, based on analyses of the Comprehensive
Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the period 1950 - 1979.  All data are
given on a 2 x 2 latitude/longitude grid.  Meteorological and oceanographic
parameters contained in this data set include air temperature, mixed layer
temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, sea
level pressure, salinity, absorbed solar radiation, outgoing longwave
radiation, net radiation, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, net downward
heat flux, net freshwater flux, buoyancy flux, frictional velocity, newtonian
cooling rate, and transfer coefficient for latent heat.  Precipitation data
were prepared by Dennis Shea.  It was derived from land or island station
records and completed by satellite observations.  Salinity data required to
compute buoyancy fluxes were taken from Levitus.  All input data were monthly
mean climatological values except the surface salinity.  Because of the small
variation of the climatological mean surface salinity throughout the year,
annual mean values were used.
