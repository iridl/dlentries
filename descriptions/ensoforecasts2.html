If you're familiar with the differences between the LDEO and LDEO2
products you can go directly to the analysis or data.  Otherwise read
on.

 <P>
Forecast sea surface temperature fields are produced on a monthly
basis using the Zebiak and Cane

coupled atmosphere-ocean model.  
 <P>
At present, two forecast products are available: The standard
forecasts (consistent with those issued in the NOAA Diagnostic
Bulletin over the past several years), and a newer product, referred
to as LDEO2, that utilizes a different forecast intialization scheme.
 <P>
In the standard initialization, FSU pseudo-stress anomalies (with some
filtering and smoothing as described in Cane et al, 1986, Nature) are
used to "spin up" the ocean model from 1964 until the beginning of the
forecast period; the atmosphere model is similarly spun up using the
simulated SSTA from the forced ocean run.  Thus initialized, the
coupled model runs ahead in time with no data insertion, producing a
forecast for the evolution of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system.
 <P>
For the standard product, SSTA fields from individual forecasts are
composited by lag-averaging the results from six consecutive monthly
initialconditions.  The composited forecasts for lead times of 3,6,9,
and 12 months are then post-processed using a singular value
decomposition analysis, to remove systematic spatial pattern errors
and to map the idealized model domain onto the real one.  The results
are archived from January 1972 (verification time) to the most recent
month available. 

 An analysis of the results in terms of an ENSO (El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation) index is <a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/forecast/page/page.html">here</a>.

 <P>
For the LDEO2 product, a nudging algorithm as described in Chen et al,
1995 Science, is used to initialize forecasts.  In effect, the ocean
is spun up with a weighted average of FSU and model-derived winds.
This scheme results in much reduced "initialization shock",
considerably improved forecast skill (.1 - .2 increase in correlation
at all lead times from 0 to 18 months) and reduced seasonality of
skill.  Fore the LDEO2 product, no lag-averaging is used, although
small corrections for systematic errors are made using a value
decomposition analysis.  Results are available at all lead times from
0 - 18 months.  An analysis equivalent to that above for LDEO2 can be found
 <a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/forecast/page2/page_ldeo2.html">here</a>. 
LDEO2 forecast results will  be included ASAP
