<b>One-line description:</b>
DOE Gridded Surface Precipitation and Temperature Anomalies<p>


<b>Detailed description:</b>
This global precipitation and temperature anomaly data set 
for the period 1851 through 1990 has been assembled under 
funding by the U.S. Department of Energy.<p>

NOTE:  The netCDF data in this directory are not yet completely compliant
with the CDC netCDF Standard Format.  The differences are very slight,
but should be noted.  We plan to modify the data files to be strictly
compliant with the CDC netCDF Standard Format by May 1994.<p>


<b>Archive parameters:</b>
File names are composed of abbreviated designations for the 
variable (air or precip) and time period (ann, seas, or mon):
<pre>
(variable).(time).nc
</pre>


<b>Variables and Units:</b> <pre> 
<!a href="http://ingridd.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.DOE.T/">Temperature data</a> is given in deg C.
<!a href="http://ingridd.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.DOE.RAIN">Precipitation data</a> is given in mm.
</pre>
These data are in the process of being cataloged here.<p>

<b>Precision:</b>
Grid point anomalies have been calculated to an 
accuracy of .01 deg C for temperature data.  This does 
not necessarily reflect the accuracy of the original 
data, however.  Individual monthly grid point anomalies
are probably accurate to .2 deg C.
Precipitation data includes a precision of .01 mm for 
monthly data and .001 for seasonal data.  The individual
monthly grid point anomalies are probably accurate to
10 mm.<p>
