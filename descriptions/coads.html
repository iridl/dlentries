<h1>Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS):
Trimmed Monthly Summaries </h1>
The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.COADS/">here</a>.
<h2>BRIEF</h2>
(Cited from <a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/data/NASAentries/nasa3276.html">COADS</a>)<p>

"In January 1981, a cooperative project was planned to create a consistent and
easily used historical record of surface marine data for the period 1854-1979
(Woodruff, et al., 1987). Members of this project were the National Climatic
Data Center (NCDC), Environmental Research Laboratories, the cooperative
Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, and the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.  The culmination of four years of work resulted in the
Comprehensive  Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) (Slutz, et al., 1985,
hereafter referred to as COADS Release 1)."
<p>
"One of the many products of COADS was a unique set of surface marine ship
reports in a modified TD-1129 format covering the period 1854-1979 (TD-1170).
This document provides information only for COADS pre-1970s surface marine
data.  A similar  COADS product covering the period 1970-1979 (TD-1129) is
described in a Marine Data Users Reference, 1970-current (NCDC, 1986). Data
Prior to 1854 is contained in the Maury collection."
<p>
"Products now available in a first release from this Comprehensive
Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) include fully quality-controlled (trimmed)
reports and summaries. Global marine data observed during 1854-1979, primarily
by ships-of-opportunity, have been collected, edited, and summarized
statistically for each month of the period, using 2 degree latitude x 2 degree
longitude boxes.  Each of the 70 million unique reports contain 28 elements of
weather, position, etc., as well as flags indicating which observations were
statistically trimmed. The summaries give l4 statistics, such as the median
and mean, for each of eight observed variables of air and sea surface
temperatures, wind, pressure, humidity, and cloudiness, plus ll derived
variables. Relatively noisy (untrimmed) individual reports and summaries
(giving l4 statistics for each of the eight observed variables) are available
for investigators who prefer their own quality control. Two other report forms,
inventories, and decade-month summaries are among the other products available.
FORTRAN 77 software available to help read 'packed binary' data products and
processing details, such as the method of identifying duplicate reports, are
also available."
<p>
"The Compressed Marine Reports contain 28 frequently used parameters, omitting
individual ship numbers. Statistical outliers are flagged. The entire set is
stored in binary format. Refer to COADS Release 1, Supplement E, for further
details. The Long Marine Reports contain the complete observational record of
the platform which contributed the data, as well as quality flags.  The data
are stored in a hybrid format of packed binary and character.  Further
information on format is available in COADS Release 1, Supplement F.
Character-formatted Long Marine Reports, a subset of the Long Marine Reports,
are stored in ASCII character format, more fully described in Supplement I of
COADS, Release 1."
<p>
"The Decadal and Monthly Summaries are averaged by decade and month over either
10 x 10 or 2 x 2 latitude-longitude boxes. In trimmed versions of these
summaries statistical outliers and data located over land have been removed.
The data are stored in packed binary format. Further details can be obtained
from COADS Release 1, Supplement A."
<p>
"Monthly Summary Trimmed and Untrimmed Groups (the former is the only
kind presented here in LDEO -- AK)  contain fewer variables and
fewer statistical parameters than the monthly summaries.  The sort is by year,
month and 2 degree latitude-longitude box. This product is the most compact
and generally the most convenient to use for studies involving only a
few variables and statistical parameters.  COADS Release 1, Supplement B
gives further details."

</pre><h2>SPECIFIC FEATURES OF LOCAL (LDEO, Climate Modelling Group) STORAGE</h2>

<a href="http://rosie.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.COADS/">Our data</a>
are a subset of the original COADS MSTG 
(Monthly Summary Trimmed Groups) data. The following variables are included:
<dl compact>
<dt> u <dd>Zonal Wind Velocity (m/s)
<dt> v <dd>Meridional Wind Velocity (m/s)
<dt> |u| <dd> Windspeed (m/s)
<dt> slp <dd> Sea Level Pressure (mb)
<dt> sst <dd> Sea Surface Temperature (C)
<dt> tair <dd> Air Temperature (C)
<dt> shum <dd> Specific Humidity (g/kg)
</dl>
and they are characterized by the  following statistical values describing 
the monthly populations of 2x2 geographical boxes:
<dl compact>
<dt> mean <dd> mean data
<dt> stdev <dd>standard deviation
<dt>nobs<dd>number of observations
<dt>xlon<dd>mean longitude of observations
<dt>ylat<dd>mean latitude of observations
</dl>

Data were extracted from COADS tapes and rewritten into economical direct
access format on disk by Alexey Kaplan, alexeyk@rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu
in March, 1994.
