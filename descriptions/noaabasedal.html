    <h1>NOAA Daily Global Summary of Day (GOBALSOD) Station Data</h1>
Some of the data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.DAILY/">here</a>.
<p>
The following information describes the global surface summary
of day data built monthly by the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC) in Asheville, NC.  The hourly data used in building these
daily summaries are obtained from the Air Weather Service (AWS)
Global Climatology Division, located in the Federal Climate Complex 
with NCDC.  The latest month of the daily summary data is placed
on line by NCDC for easy access and download by outside users, and
is normally available about 1 month after the end of the data month.
Over 8000 stations' data are typically included each month.  They
are accessible through our mosaic/www server (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) 
or through direct ftp connection.  Other periods of the summary of day 
data (up to 20 years or more) can be obtained off-line from NCDC.    

The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each
station) are:
<ul>
<li>Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit)
<li>Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit)
<li>Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb)
<li>Mean station pressure (.1 mb)
<li>Mean visibility (.1 miles)
<li>Mean wind speed (.1 knots)
<li>Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots)
<li>Maximum wind gust (.1 knots)
<li>Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit)
