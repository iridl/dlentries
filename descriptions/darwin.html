    <h1>Darwin SLP data set</h1>

The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.Darwin/.slp/">here</a>.
<p>	
	These Sea Level Pressure (SLP) measurements at Darwin was
provided to us by Julie Cole (now located at?).  It covered the period
from Jan of 1882 through early 1991.  I located a source for
continuing updated information at the CAC climate bulletin:
<p>
	nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices
<p>
The climate bulletin runs from 1951 through the present and its contents
are identical with the period Jan 1951 through early 1991 provided by
Julie.  The source of the earlier segment of the record are not known
to me.
<p>
This is an important index for measuring ENSO.
<p>
	The values are in millibars over
the value of 1000 (i.e. a SLP measurement of 1107 is shown as 107).
