<h1>Levitus Quality-Controlled NODC Station Data; Temperature, Salinity, and Oxygen </h1>
at Standard Levels                                                              

<h2>BRIEF</h2>
These data contain approximately 553,000 quality controlled profiles reporting
temperature, salinity and oxygen for standard levels, in non-NODC format (hence
the designation Level A; see quality field).  These profiles represent a
quality controlled version of the NODC Station Data File (SDF) as of 1978.  The
quality control techniques used to produce this version of the SDF are
described in the CLIMATOLOGICAL ATLAS OF THE WORLD OCEAN (Levitus, 1988); see
references.
<p>
These data are being made available because of the recognition that one set of
objectively analyzed, smoothed fields such as presented in the ATLAS cannot
satisfy all the needs of various investigators.  Having a quality controlled
version of the data will allow investigators to analyze and grid data in
whatever manner most suited to their purpose.
<p>
There are two points to beware. In the ATLAS it was noted that because of
numerous quality control problems, salinity data below 400 meters depth from
the Soviet Union were not used in the preparation of the objectively analyzed
fields.  Those data are, nonetheless, still included in this tape.
<p>
The second point is that the final step of the quality control procedure was
simply to eliminate one-degree square means that produced very unrealistic
features in the objective analysis.  Those data are, again, still included in
this tape.

Quality Statement:
 

These data are termed Level A by NODC, indicating that they are in 'originator'
format, rather than standard NODC format. While they have had no quality
assurance checking at NODC, they have in fact received extensive quality
checking; see references.
