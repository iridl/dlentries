<p>
The Ocean Climate Laboratory (OCL) at the National Oceanographic Data Center
(NODC) is supported by the NOAA Climate and Global Change program to produce
scientifically quality controlled oceanographic databases.  Work to date
includes quality control of historical in situ temperature, salinity, oxygen,
phosphate, nitrate, and silicate data and the preparation of one-degree
latitude-longitude mean fields for each of these parameters using objective
analysis techniques.  Specifically, this project has produced four ocean
atlases describing the global distributions of these parameters and two
technical reports describing the quality control and processing procedures
(see section 6 of this documentation for a listing of these publications).  

Observed and standard level profile data (along with quality control flags)
used in the production of these atlases are being made available to the
international oceanographic community on the World Ocean Atlas 1994 CD-ROM
series (referred to herein as WOA94).  In addition, the CD-ROM series contains
the objectively analyzed one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each of
the measured parameters, and two derived parameters (Apparent Oxygen
Utilization and oxygen saturation), and five-degree square statistics of
standard level values.

Profile data on the CD-ROM series are recorded in ASCII format and sorted
geographically, so they are easy to access and manipulate. The CD-ROMs are
formatted in the ISO 9660 standard.  

The Ocean Climate Laboratory expresses its thanks to all those who provided us
with their comments and helped us develop an improved product.

<h3>A. DATA SOURCES</h3>

The data used in this project are all the data found in the NODC archives as
of the first quarter of 1993.  Levitus and Gelfeld (1992) show global
distribution maps of the data held in these files for all years (1900-1992). 
In addition, data gathered as a result of the NODC's National Oceanographic
Data Archaeology and Rescue (NODAR) and the IOC/IODE Global Oceanographic Data
Archaeology and Rescue (GODAR) projects, not yet incorporated into the NODC
master archives, were included in this study.  A description of the NODAR and
GODAR projects can be found in Levitus et al. (1994e).  The NODAR and GODAR
data sets are in separate files (since they have not yet been archived at the
NODC).

<h3>C.  QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES</h3>

Observed level data were checked for quality prior to interpolation to
standard levels.  We call the actual measured value of an oceanographic
parameter at some depth an "observed level" datum.  The value interpolated to
a standard level depth is referred to as a "standard level" datum.
<p>
For many analysis purposes, it is necessary to interpolate from observed level
to standard depth levels.  The standard depth analysis levels selected for
this study are listed in Table 3 and include the 30 NODC standard depths and
three additional levels at 3500, 4500, and 5500 meters.  There are additional
standard level depth data in some of the standard level profiles (i.e., 6000,
6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000 meters, numbered 34 through 40).

</pre>
The quality of the observed and standard level data were checked using the
following procedures:
<p>
At the NODC:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>1.<dd>  NODC Data Processing Branch checks - date/time fields (valid
    values, ship speed between stations).  It also performs broad 
    range checks, compares each station to an NODC T-S climatology, 
    and checks for large density inversions.
</dl>
At the NODC/Ocean Climate Laboratory:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>2.<dd>  Preliminary checks - checks for duplicate profiles, depth inversions;
<dt>3.<dd>  Range check of the observed level data for each major basin as a function                     
    of depth; 
    [Note: some temperature values reported in the XBT2 observed level file 
    exceeded 999.999 and therefore were set to the missing value -99.999.  
    These values are flagged with a 1 (failed range check).]
<dt>4.<dd>  Large temperature inversion and gradient checks;
<dt>5.<dd>  Density inversion check on the standard level data;
<dt>6.<dd>  XBT drop rate correction before interpolation of observed level to 
    standard level data for T4, T6, and T7 probes;
<dt>7.<dd>  Standard deviation check; 
<dt>8.<dd>  Check for unrealistic features after an initial computation of the 
    objective analysis.
<p>Data were flagged for each quality control check.  A datum or profile flagged
as an outlier was excluded from further checks.  A description of the flags
can be found in Appendix 1.  The quality control procedures have been
documented in two NOAA Technical Reports (Boyer and Levitus, 1994; Conkright
et al., 1994).

            Hemisphere convention.  The seasons are defined as:
                  Winter (January - March)
                  Spring (April - June)
                  Summer (July - September)
                  Fall (October - December)
*** MONTH - data composite for each month.  January through December 
            analysis for 19 depth levels only (0-1000 m)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
For all the files in Table 4, there are accompanying mask files. The mask file
contains the number of grid points which contain data within the radius of
influence surrounding each grid box.  If a grid box contains three or fewer
observations within its radius of influence, the mask value for that
one-degree square will be zero.  This file is used in plotting routines to
"mask" or cover up areas with three or less observations (see maps in the
World Ocean Atlases for fields plotted using these masks).

EXPLANATION OF ERROR FLAGS


A.  CHECK FOR DEPTH INVERSIONS AND DUPLICATE DEPTHS

Depth error flags:

(1)  If the second of two successive depths is shallower than the first (a
     depth inversion), the second depth will be marked with a flag value = 1.  

(2)  If two successive depths are shallower than the first depth, every depth
     reading following the first will be marked with a flag value = 1.

(3)  If two successive depth readings are equal, the second reading will be
     marked with a flag value = 1.

(4)  All correct depths are marked with a flag value = 0.


B.   STANDARD DEVIATION CHECK ON STANDARD LEVEL DATA

This check calculates the mean and standard deviation of five-degree square
latitude-longitude boxes for annual (all parameters), seasonal (temperature,
salinity, and oxygen), and monthly (temperature and salinity) periods.

Data are flagged if

(1)  a value is five standard deviations away from the mean in coastal waters
     (defined as any five-degree grid box adjacent to a land grid point or any
     five-degree grid box with a bottom depth of less than 200 m);

(2)  a value is four standard deviations away from the mean in near coastal
     waters or near the ocean floor (defined as any one-degree grid point
     where the depth is equal to or less than the depth in an adjacent 
     one-degree box) or any adjacent five-degree grid box is designated 
     coastal;

(3)  a value is three standard deviations away from the mean in open ocean;

(4)  if a profile contains two or more standard deviation failures, the
     whole profile is flagged. 




C.   DENSITY CHECKS FOR TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY PROFILES

The criteria for an instability are described by Levitus (1982).  


Flags are assigned 

(1)  for density inversions at the depths where they occur in the observed and
     standard level profiles;

(2)   when two or more density inversions (or instabilities) occur in a
      standard level profile. The entire profile is then flagged.

[Note: Stability checks were performed on observed as well as standard level
data.  Observed level flags are included for information only, since they were
not used to exclude any data from the profile data sets.  Whole-profile flags
for stability and standard deviation checks are for standard level data only. 
For informational purposes, if a standard level profile includes a whole
profile density flag (or standard deviation flag), the observed level data
will also include a whole profile flag.]


D.   CRUISE FLAGS 

Indicates all profiles from a cruise have anomalous data.  


E.   BULLSEYE FLAGS 

Flags individual depths with anomalous data which cause ripple effects or
"bullseyes" in the contoured objectively analyzed data.
