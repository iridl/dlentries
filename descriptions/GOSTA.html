<h1>Global Ocean Surface Temperature Atlas (GOSTA) </h1>
The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.GOSTA/">here</a>.<p>
This is the January 1993 version of the Global Ocean Surface
Temperature Atlas (GOSTA, Bottomley et al., 1990) referred to as
ATLAS7. The data in this atlas are a compilation of marine
observations from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office Main Marine
Data Bank with some additional data from the US Fleet Numerical
Oceanography Center. The Atlas includes the climatology of sea
surface temperature (SST) and the difference between marine nighttime
air temperature (NMAT) and SST. These climatologies are based on data
collected between 1951 and 1980. Also included are SST and NMAT
monthly anomalies from 1856 to 1991. The data were corrected to remove
what are believed to be observational biases due to changes in
instrumentation. These correction are based on scientific research
summarized in the introduction to the hard-copy version of GOSTA
(Bottomley et al., 1990). All data are presented on a 5 by 5
degree grid wherever data existed. The climatology of SST can be made
available on a 1 by 1 degree grid. 
<p>
The quality of marine observations is thoroughly discussed in the hard
copy volume of GOSTA as well as in the references therein. The user
should note that the data were collected using a variety of
instruments and observational procedures aboard vessels of different
shapes and dimensions.
