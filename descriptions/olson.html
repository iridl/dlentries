<h2>Documentation for the Major Ecosystem Complexes (Olson Vegetation)</h2>


The Olson Vegetation data set represents the world's Major Ecosystem Complexes ranked by the amounts of carbon in live
vegetation.  It is available <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.ECOSYSTEMS/.Olson/">here</a>.
<p>It was compiled by Jerry Olson, J. Watts and L. Allison at the Environmental Sciences Division of the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA. The data set has a one-half degree by one-half degree latitude/ longitude
resolution and a total of 44 land ecosystem classes. It was compiled from patterns of pre-agricultural vegetation, modern
aerial surveys and inten- sive biomass data from research sites. The reference for this data set is "Olson, J. S., J. A. Watts
and L. J. Allison, 1983. <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp017/ndp017appA.pdf">Carbon in Live Vegetation of Major World Ecosystems, Report ORNL-5862</a>, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA."
