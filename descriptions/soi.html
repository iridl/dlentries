    <h1>Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)</h1>

The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.soi/">here</a>.

<p> The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is the difference between the
	standardized Tahiti Sea Level Pressure (SLP) and the
	standardized Darwin SLP measurements. They are provided by the
	CAC climate bulletin:
<p>
	<a href="file://nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices">nic.fb4.noaa.gov:pub/cac/cddb/indices</a>
<p>
This is an important index for measuring ENSO.
<p>
The climate bulletin runs from 1951 through the present.
<p>
We also have the standardized SOI from 1881-present <a
