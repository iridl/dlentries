<p>
     Contains monthly and annual atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations
     derived from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's continuous
     monitoring program at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.  This
     record constitutes the longest continuous record of atmospheric
     CO2 concentrations available in the world.  Monthly and annual
     average mole fractions of CO2 in water-vapor-free air are given
     from march 1958 through 1991, except for a few interruptions.
