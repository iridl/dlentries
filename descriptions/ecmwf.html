<h1>ECMWF Gridded Global Analyses 1985-1992 </h1>
The data are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.ECMWF/">here</a>.<p>
We have gridded global analyses from the European Center for
Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, England for the years
1985-1992 inclusive.  The analyses are uninitialized, meaning
that observed data have been assimilated into the ECMWF forecast
model but have not been altered by the model's normal mode
initialization scheme.  The analyses are monthly averages.
<p>
All variables are on 14 pressure levels which are in mb:
<p>
10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 700, 850, 1000
<p>
The variables currently in the data catalog are:
<p>
temperature, zonal and meridional velocity and geopotential.
<p>
In addition there are surface fields of surface pressure,
surface geopotential and temperature 2m above the surface.  All
these are gridded on a 2.5 by 2.5 degree grid.
<p>
These data sets were derived from the archived ECMWF analyses 
that, in their entirety, are maintained on tape.  Other
variables that could be read from the tapes and formatted
and cataloged like the data mentioned above are:
<p>
relative humidity, land-sea mask, surface temperature, 10m winds
and vertical velocity.
<p>
If anyone wishes to see these variables they should contact
Richard Seager who will arrange for reading them off the ECMWF 
tapes.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li> There are some problems with the data.  In particular there are several
dubious months and data points during 1985.  We advise eliminating
1985 data from any application you intend to perform.

<li> The vertical velocity contains possible problems (personal
communication from Kevin Trenberth) due to its' derivation in a way that
is inconsistent with the model equations.

<li> Note that in regions of topography data values at analysis levels
that fall below the actual surface are extrapolated down from surface
values (see Trenberth et al. 1993 for a discussion).
