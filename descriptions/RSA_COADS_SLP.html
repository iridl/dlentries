     <h1> Reduced Space Optimal Analysis of the COADS Global Sea Level
      Pressure  Anomalies  </h1>
<p> 

<p> Reduced Space Optimal Analysis has been applied to the global sea
	  level pressure (SLP)
record of COADS. The
results of the analysis are <a

here </a>.

<p> The COADS data on which the analysis was based can be viewed e.g.
