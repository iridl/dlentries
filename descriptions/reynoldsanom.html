  <body><h1>Monthly NMC SST Anomaly analyzed fields</h1>
These SST Anomalies (SSTA) are computed from the NMC <a href="reynolds.html">monthly sst</a> fields
    and <a href="reynoldsclimo.html">climatology</a>.
<p>
The fields are <a href="http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IGOSS/.nmc/.monthly/.ssta/">here</a>.
<p>
What follows is a description of the weekly analysis that the monthly
    analysis is based upon.
<p>
The OI sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is produced weekly on a
one-degree grid.  The analysis uses in situ and satellite SST's plus
SST's simulated by sea-ice cover.  Before the analysis is computed, the
satellite data is adjusted for biases using the method of Reynolds
(<a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Reynolds1988">1988</a>) and Reynolds and Marsico (<a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Reynolds:Marsico1993">1993</a>).  A description of the OI
analysis can be found in Reynolds and Smith (<a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Reynolds:Smith1994">1994</a>). The bias correction
improves the large scale accuracy of the OI.  Examples of the effect of
recent corrections is given by Reynolds (<a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Reynolds1993">1993</a>).
<p>
For the more recent period, 1990-present, the in situ data were
obtained from radio messages carried on the Global Telecommunication
System.  The satellite observations were obtained from operational data
produced by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information
Service (NESDIS).  
<p>
During the period 1981-1989, the in situ data were obtained from the
Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the 1980s.  These
data (see <a
      href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Slutz:etal1985">Slutz, et al., 1985</a>, and <a href="http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/bibfind_html?Woodruff:etal1993">Woodruff, et al., 1993</a>) consist of
logbook and radio reports.  The satellite data were obtained from
analyses of NESDIS data produced at the University of Miami's Rosentiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. 
<p>
The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas.  There is no analysis
over land.  The land values are filled by a Cressman interpolation to
produce a complete grid for possible interpolation.
