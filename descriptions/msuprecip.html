<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>
<h3>	1.1 Dataset Overview</h3>
	Version 2 of this dataset includes daily 2.5 deg gridpoint fields of 
deep-layer average temperatures derived from the Microwave Sounding 
Units for:
<dl compact>
<dt>1<dd>  the lower troposphere (channel "2/3"); 
<dt>2<dd>  the (tropical) upper troposphere (channel "3/4");
<dt>3<dd>  the lower stratosphere (channel 4); and	
<dt>4<dd>  oceanic rainfall estimates.
</dl>
	The dataset period of record is 1979-93 for the temperatures, and 
1979- May 1994 for oceanic rainfall.  The NOAA satellites contributing 
to this dataset are, in order of their launch, TIROS-N, NOAA-6, -7, -9,-
10,-11, and NOAA-12.  NOAA-8 data were not used due to poor data 
quality.  Each of the datasets have their own error characteristics, 
discussed below.  Version 2 of the dataset will be replaced in 
approximately one year by Version 3, which will include a 1994  update 
to the time series, and will likely include various algorithm 
improvements, the most important of which will be in the limb 
correction procedure..  
	<h3>1.2 Our Guiding Philosophy</h3>
	No satellite dataset is perfect, and the MSU datasets are no 
exception to this rule.   Issues such as satellite intercalibration, limb 
correction, and algorithm improvement each involve a long list of 
decisions which must be made,  and each of these decisions could be 
improved upon. While we know we can improve the datasets beyond 
their present state, we also recognize the need to make them available to 
researchers whose research objects are already attainable with the 
datasets in their present form.  
<p>
	We also find that these decisions often depend upon what purpose 
the datasets would be used for, so that in general we believe that there is 
no "best" version of a dataset of our  parameters.  Instead, datasets are 
constructed  for specific purposes and the many decisions which must be 
made in the construction of the dataset are made with those purposes in 
mind.
<p> 
	We have decided to provide the present version of this dataset to 
researchers so that they can be exploited for purposes which the dataset 
error characteristics will allow, and with the hope that feedback from 
the users will help to make Version 3 (and later versions) still more 
useful for a wider range of research efforts.  
<p>
	The authors would appreciate a preprint of manuscripts submitted 
for publication which include research based upon these datasets. Users 
should always obtain the latest available dataset Version and

<h2>2. The MSU Instrument</h2>
	The Microwave Sounding Units were built by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory for NOAA to fly as part of the TIROS Operational Vertical 
Sounder (TOVS) instrument complement aboard the TIROS-N series of 
sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites.   The MSU is a four-channel 
Dicke-type scanning microwave radiometer observing passive 
microwave radiation at 50.3, 53.74, 54.96, and 57.95 GHz, which are 
frequencies in the 50 to 60 GHz oxygen absorption complex.    As the 
instrument scans, it measures microwave radiation at eleven beam 
positions over a swath about 2000 km wide. The scan period is 25.6 
seconds, which combined with the satellite orbital speed, results in scan-
to-scan separation of about 150 km.   The spatial resolution of the 
measurements, defined by the half-power (3 dB) beamwidth  of  7.5 deg
and  the range from the satellite to the observed point on the earth,  
varies from about 110 km at the nadir (#6) beam position to near 200 km 
at the extreme (#1 and #11) beam positions.  
<p>
	Once every earth scan, the instrument  makes calibration 
measurements, viewing deep space (2.7K) and high emissivity warm 
targets.  There is one target for the two lower frequencies (channels 1 
and 2) and  another for the two highest frequencies (channels 3 and 4).  
The temperature of each  target is monitored with redundant platinum 
resistance thermometers (PRT's).  Calibration of the instrument digital 
counts into brightness temperatures (Tb) is simply a linear interpolation 
of the Earth-viewing measurements between the space and warm target 
measurements (see Spencer et al., 1990).    Please refer to Smith et al. 
(1979) for further details of the MSU.
<h2>3.  What the MSU Measures</h2>
	The MSU was designed to be used together with the High 
Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) and Stratospheric Sounding Unit 
(SSU) to obtain vertical atmospheric temperature profiles from space.  
Compared to the HIRS channel weighting functions,  the MSU has 
poorer vertical resolution in the troposphere and better vertical 
resolution in the stratosphere.  It has considerably poorer spatial 
resolution than the HIRS, but this gives the advantage of a much lower 
data rate and thus a more manageable data volume for analyses of the 
fifteen year data archive.  The MSU is essentially insensitive to non-
precipitating cirriform clouds, and so should provide a more robust air 
temperature signal than the HIRS.  It is considerably less sensitive to 
liquid phase clouds than the HIRS.  Neither instrument can measure air 
temperatures within precipitation.<p>
	MSU channel 1 (50.3) GHz  (Fig. 1)  has only weak oxygen 
absorption and so is sensitive to air temperature in only the lowest few 
kilometers of the atmosphere.  However, this temperature information is 
heavily contaminated by other influences such as surface temperature 
and emissivity, as well as water vapor and liquid and precipitation-size 
ice hydrometeors in the troposphere.  This limits the utility of channel 1 
for monitoring lower tropospheric temperatures.  MSU channel 2  
(53.74 GHz)  is sensitive to deep layer average tropospheric 
temperatures with a weighting function peaking near 500 hPa.  It is only 
very slightly affected by variations in tropospheric humidity (see Spencer 
et al., 1990),  but is contaminated by precipitation-size ice in deep 
convective clouds, which can cause Tb depressions of up to 15 deg C in 
midlatitude squall lines.  High elevation terrain protruding into the MSU 
channel 2 weighting function results in proportionally less of its 
measured radiation coming from thermal emission by the air and more 
coming from the surface.  The MSU channel 3 (54.96 GHz) weighting 
function peaks near 250 hPa and  so often straddles the extratropical 
tropopause.  MSU channel 4 (57.95 GHz) has its peak weighting at 70 
hPa, and  provides a good measure of lower stratospheric deep-layer 
temperatures.	<p>
	Because  the four MSU weighting functions overlap, they  can be 
combined to retrieve information over thinner layers than the individual 
weighting functions represent (Conrath, 1972).  This is the fundamental 
basis of satellite temperature retrieval schemes.  For instance, a fraction 
of channel 3 can be subtracted from channel 2 to eliminate the lower 
stratospheric influence on channel 2 for middle and lower tropospheric 
temperature monitoring (Fig. 1).  Similarly, a fraction of channel 4 can 
be subtracted from channel 3 for monitoring of upper tropospheric 
temperatures in the tropics, where the tropopause is near 100 hPa.  In 
addition, because the MSU scans across the satellite subtrack at eleven 
different beam positions (six different Earth incidence angles symmetric 
about the center footprint), each channel actually has six slightly 
different weighting functions due to the variations of the view angle 
through the atmosphere.  These different view angles can also be 
combined into a new weighting function, although  this is done at the 
expense  of any information about temperature gradients across the 
swath and, if the combinations are symmetric about the nadir 
measurement, the resulting retrieval represents an average temperature 
for the entire swath (Spencer et al., 1992b).  This technique is more 
useful for gridpoint temperature monitoring over long  time scales, or 
zonal averages over short time scales,  where the errors due to 
horizontal gradients are averaged out.   <p>
	The lower tropospheric air temperature influence on channel 1 is 
small compared to other influences, such as land emissivity and oceanic 
air mass humidity and liquid water path.   In particular, we have used 
channel 1  to retrieve oceanic rainfall since its variability over the  
ocean is dominated by cloud and rain water activity. 
<h2>4.  Stability of the MSU Calibration </h2>
	The MSU is externally calibrated, with the warm target and cold 
(deep space)  radiation traveling through the same instrumental paths as 
the earth-view radiation.  Therefore, changes in instrument temperature 
and gain are canceled out in the calibration procedure.   We have 
quantitatively documented the high levels of stability for MSU  channels 
2 (Spencer and Christy, 1992a) and 4 (Spencer and Christy, 1993).  We 
perform our own calibration of the instrument, the procedures for which 
were described by Spencer et al. (1990).  There is evidence of drift in 
MSU channel 3 of up to 1 deg C (or more) in a couple of the satellites 
(NOAA-6 and NOAA-9), and corrections for this are discussed below.   
While drift in MSU channel 1 has not yet been rigorously addressed, the 
rainfall retrievals we have made using channel 1 data show no obvious 
evidence of drift in MSU channel 1, but further work needs to be done 
to quantify this. <p>
	We have found no evidence of calibration drift in any of the 
channels on time scales that would significantly affect variations within 
individual days, or the computations of day-to-day temperature changes.
<h2>5. Dataset  Characteristics</h2>
<h3>	5.1 Deep Layer Temperatures</h3>
	MSU channels 2, 3, and 4  respond primarily to air temperature 
through their sensitivity to thermal emission by molecular oxygen, a well 
mixed and temporally stable atmospheric constituent.  The weighting 
functions for these channels (Fig. 1)  are quite broad in their response to 
temperature fluctuations at different altitudes.   By linearly combining 
two or more channels, we can achieve sensitivity to shallower layers 
than the raw MSU channels represent.  For the datasets described here,  
linear "averaging kernels" (Conrath, 1972) are produced for the lower 
troposphere; (tropical) upper troposphere;  and the lower stratospheric 
measurements are taken from MSU channel 4 alone.  
<h4>	5.1.1  Averaging kernels</h4>
	MSU channels 2 and 3 are linearly combined to form an 
averaging kernel (Tb23 = 1.6Tb2 - 0.6Tb3) which peaks near 500 hPa 
and has most of its radiant energy originating below about  300 hPa 
(Fig. 1).  We loosely call this our "lower tropospheric" temperature 
measurement.   In regions of high terrain, especially over Greenland, the 
Andes, Himalayas, and portions of Antarctica, most of the energy comes 
from the surface and so can not be interpreted as an air temperature 
measurement. The Tb23 data will have little utility in these regions.  <p>
	MSU channels 3 and 4 are combined  to form an averaging 
kernel (Tb34=1.35Tb3 - 0.35Tb4) which peaks near 250 hPa and 
receives most of its energy from the 500 - 100 hPa layer.  We call this 
retrieval the "upper tropospheric" temperature, however, we only 
calculate it for latitudes 30 S to 30 N because the retrieval is only 
applicable in the tropics where the tropopause generally lies above 100 
hPa. Tb34 is only slightly affected by high terrain.  <p>
	Our "lower stratospheric" measurements come from channel 4 
alone.
<h4>	5.1.2 Drift in channel 3 calibration</h4>
	MSU channels 2 and 4 have been documented to have no 
statistically significant  drift in their calibration.  All overlaps between 
satellite coverage have revealed no trend in the differences between 
satellites for these two channels at the level of a few hundredths of a 
degree Celsius over several years (see Spencer and Christy, 1992a for 
statistics on channel 2; Spencer and Christy, 1994 for channel 4).  <p>
	Unfortunately, a couple of the MSU's (NOAA-6 and NOAA-9)  
had considerable drift in MSU channel 3. This drift seems to have only a 
low frequency component, occurring on a time scale of months to years, 
rather than from day to day (although an abrupt change was noticed on 
November 1, 1986 for NOAA-9).  Since the averaging kernels for 
channels 2/3 and 3/4 both depend on channel 3, their fields needed 
adjustment for this drift.  To achieve this adjustment for channel 2/3, we 
have forced the monthly, 30 deg zonally averaged anomalies to match those 
produced by channel 2R (see Spencer and Christy, 1992b).  Channel 2R 
is a lower tropospheric retrieval which depends upon channel 2 alone 
and which uses the different view angles of channel 2 to produce a lower 
tropospheric averaging kernel.  The channel 2R averaging kernel peaks 
somewhat lower in the troposphere than the channel "2/3" kernel, but 
we assume that their differences in monthly, zonally averaged anomalies 
are probably small.  The 2R trend-adjusted channel 2/3 data can be used 
for long-term trend analyses on global, zonal, or gridpoint scales.  The 
channel 2R procedures used here for satellite intercalibration (discussed 
below) differ somewhat from those in Spencer and Christy (1992b), and 
so can be expected to produce small differences in the resulting 
anomalies and trends.<p>
	The drift in channel 3 inferred from comparisons to channel 2R 
was then used to adjust the channel 3/4 measurements as well, but these 
adjustments have been made based upon only the tropical  drifts.  We do 
not have as much confidence in the long-term stability of the channel 3/4 
fields, and they are provided here as an experimental product which is 
still undergoing evaluation and refinement. The interannual variability in 
the tropics, however, should be quite stable.  The primary reason why 
we have released this field for distribution is that it has interesting day-
to-day and interannual variability in the deep tropics.<p>
	The channel 4 fields have the best long term stability of the three 
temperature products provided.  There has been no evidence of drift 
during  any of the overlaps in satellite coverage.  The only calibration 
problem we have noticed is for the NOAA-12 MSU, which showed an 
annual cycle in polar temperatures that was significantly different from 
all of the other satellites.  It was found that this could be corrected with 
a simple linear scaling of the data which can be interpreted  as a 
calibration slope error of about 2%.
<h4>	5.1.3 Limb correction and satellite intercalibration</h4>
	Because the MSU is a through-nadir scanner, the eleven 
footprints across the MSU swath width come from six different earth 
incidence angles (nadir, and two each at 11, 22, 33, 44, and 55 deg 
earth incidence angles on either side of nadir).  Due to the longer 
atmospheric path lengths that the non-nadir views have compared to the 
nadir view, the corresponding weighting functions are lifted to higher 
levels.  Thus, some sort of "limb correction" must be performed for all 
three deep layer measurements (channels 2/3, 3/4, and 4) if a spatially 
uniform field of temperatures is to be produced, i.e. temperatures on a 
constant pressure "surface".   (Some numerical weather prediction 
modeling efforts are now focusing on the assimilation of raw radiances 
at their original view angles so that the data are not corrupted  by 
assumptions inherent to limb corrections). <p>
	The Version 1 limb correction procedure (see Fig. 2) relies on 
the compilation of statistics over many years of the average relationships  
between a nadir measurement and a non-nadir measurement at a specific 
location (2.5 deg gridpoint); month; type of satellite (7:30 local time or 
2:30 local time); and ascending or descending node of the satellite 
(ascending is p.m.; descending is a.m.).  Third order polynomial 
regression equations  then provide the Tb adjustments necessary to 
"correct" the non-nadir measurements to nadir.  Thus, for each of the 
three atmospheric layers, there are approximately 480,000 limb 
correction equations (=10,000 gridpoints x 2 satellite times x 2 nodal 
crossing times x 12 months).  These equations account for variations in 
both atmospheric lapse rate and surface temperature which vary 
seasonally and geographically.  In the case of channel 2/3 and 3/4, drift 
in the calibration of channel 3 is inferred from the difference in channel 
2/3  and 2R for monthly, 30 deg zonally averaged anomalies for the entire 
period of record (see Fig. 2).<p>
	Because channel 4 has not exhibited any evidence of calibration 
drift (Spencer and Christy, 1993), the intercalibration between 
successive satellites was accomplished by first limb correcting and 
gridding the daily channel 4 data by the same procedure represented on 
the left side of Fig. 2, then adjusting for the differences between 
satellites during operational overlap periods with those adjustments being 
averaged for each of 12 months  in 10 deg latitude bands.
<h4>	5.1.4 Limb correction errors</h4>
	All three layer temperature products  (channels 2/3; 3/4; and 4) 
have varying amounts of residual effects resulting from imperfect limb 
correction procedures.  These effects can sometimes be seen by 
animating daily imagery and looking for east-west patterns in the daily 
grid fields that have a spatial separation coinciding with the orbit 
sampling of the earth, and which move eastward on successive days.   
When these patterns are present, a spectrum analysis of the time series at 
these individual gridpoints will reveal spectral peaks near 4.5 days and 8 
days. These correspond to the usual rate at which the satellite orbits 
progress eastward across the sky (a function of the orbital altitude and 
inclination of a sun-synchronous satellite causing the number of orbits 
per day to not be an exact integer multiple).   <p>
	 The current channel 3/4 limb correction seems to work much 
better in the deep tropics than in the extra-tropics, and work is 
progressing on a different limb adjustment procedure suitable for the 
channel 3/4 characteristics.  Detailed daily analyses of channel 3/4 
patterns in the middle latitudes should await limb correction procedure 
improvements in a later version.<p>
	The channel 4 limb corrections seem to perform very  well for 
most of the 15 year dataset.
<h4>	5.1.5 Gridpoint error estimates</h4>
	The precision with which daily gridpoint Tb can be measured 
depends mostly upon the quality of the limb correction scheme, and to a 
lesser extent upon the sampling errors inherent in estimating a daily 
average with 1-4 "snapshots" provided by one or two satellites, and the 
limiting radiometric resolution of a single  MSU measurement (0.2 -
0.3 deg C).  There are probably other, smaller sources of error such as 
slight variations in different MSUs' weighting functions for the same 
channels.  It is important to note that all statistics reviewed below are for 
a single satellite, and the corresponding errors are smaller during two-
satellite coverage (which includes about 75% of the 15 year record, see 
the Appendix).  <p>
	 Estimates of the single-satellite standard error of measurement 
(SEM)  for the  daily deep layer temperatures are shown  in Fig. 3.  The 
statistics are computed by measuring the relative levels of  disagreement 
between two satellites'  variations in daily Tb at individual gridpoints.  
The (single satellite) standard error of measurement (SEM) is calculated 
as
<pre>
	  	     SEM =  (2**0.5/2) sd(T(sat1)  -  T(sat2))	      (1)
</pre>
where sd is the standard deviation, T is the Tb for any layer temperature 
product, and the single satellite factor (2**0.5/2) assumes that each  
satellite contributes equally to the total error.  The sd  in (1) is  
actually an average of the standard deviations for the individual years  
of 1982 (NOAA-6 and NOAA-7) and 1990 (NOAA-10 and NOAA-11).    <p>
	The channel 2/3  SEM (Fig. 3a) show that the daily gridpoint 
errors in the deep tropics generally range from 0.3 to 0.4 deg C, except 
over land areas where they usually range from 0.4 to 0.6 deg C range.  
Most mid-latitude areas have from 0.5 to 1.0 deg C SEM's.  Many high 
altitude regions, especially portions of Antarctica, Greenland, and the 
Andes Mountains, show  high standard errors of measurement (over 1 deg C),
and the highest errors occur in strongly sloping terrain (coastal 
Antarctica and Greenland).<p>
	The daily gridpoint noise estimates for channel 3/4 (Fig. 3b) are 
generally less than 0.3 deg C in the deep tropics, increasing to 0.5 or 
0.6 deg C in the middle latitudes.  The errors improve again at the high 
latitudes.  Because we know that the current limb correction scheme for 
channel 3/4 does not perform well in the middle latitudes, we expect a 
new scheme to improve the mid-latitude noise estimates in Version 2 of 
the dataset. <p>
	The daily gridpoint noise estimates for channel 4 (Fig. 3c) are 
usually below 0.2 deg C in the deep tropics, increasing to 0.3 to 0.4 deg C  
in the Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes, but reaching 0.5 to 0.6 deg C  
in the Southern Hemisphere middle latitudes.  It is believed that the large 
noise figures are caused by the variable conditions near the boundary of 
the wintertime polar vortex occurring in each hemisphere.
<h3>	5.2 Oceanic Rainfall</h3>
<h4>	5.2.1 Algorithm description</h4>
	Daily gridpoint oceanic rainfall estimates equatorward of 60 deg
latitude are made through a procedure similar to that described by 
Spencer (1993), and numerous details such as algorithm justification and 
detailed rain gauge comparisons can be found there.  <p>
	Rainfall is diagnosed when a channel 1 Tb threshold is exceeded, 
the threshold being a function of the air mass temperature deduced from 
channels 2/3 . For each 1 deg increment of channel 2/3 Tb, a 15% 
cumulative frequency distribution was calculated for the base year of 
1982 (NOAA-6 and NOAA-7).   The 15% thresholds in channel 1 vs. 
channel 2/3 Tb space was approximated by a line.  There are six of these 
linear relationships, corresponding to the six view angles of the MSU, 
which are used for all satellites.  Tb1 warming above the appropriate 
threshold is assumed to be linearly related to a footprint-averaged rain 
amount.  The conversion into rainfall units, however, was performed 
after compilation of many years of average Tb1 warming above the 
threshold from multiple satellites.  To accomplish this, careful 
intercalibration between satellites during overlapping periods of 
operation was performed in two steps.  First, we calculate a  Tb1 
"offset"  of the second satellite which produces the same frequency of 
rainfall diagnoses (typically near 15%) as that from the first satellite 
during the overlap period.  Second,  the average DTb1 above that 
threshold was then forced to equal that from the first satellite through a 
"magnification factor" which is a function of beam position and satellite.  
These two adjustments force the rain amounts diagnosed during the 
overlap period to be equal between the two satellites.  The overlaps in 
satellite coverage  which were used for intercalibration throughout the 
15 year period ranged from three months to 1 year (see the Appendix).   
[The additional step of  an air mass temperature correction described in 
Spencer (1993) was not used in Version 2 of the rainfall dataset due to 
insufficient rain gauge data at high latitudes where a large annual cycle 
in temperature exists.  However, cursor comparisons to the few high 
latitude gauges suggest that the resulting MSU rainfall diagnoses might 
be biased low during the cold season.  Thus, studies of the annual cycle 
in extratropical rainfall with this dataset might be compromised.]<p>
	Monthly gridpoint averages of this warming were compared to 7-
10 years of monthly rain gauge totals at 123 island and coastal locations 
throughout the world, and a single scale factor was derived which scaled 
the DTb1 into rain units.  The locations of these gauges (part of a dataset 
described by Eischeid et al. (1991)) was shown by Spencer (1993).  The 
subsequent production of daily rain grids simply used the monthly 
calibration factor divided by the average number of days in a month 
(30.4). <p>
	The channel 1 signal is actually sensitive to cloud water as well 
as rain water, an ambiguity common to all passive microwave emission 
schemes for measuring rainfall, but which is particularly true at a 
frequency as high as channel 1 (50.3 GHz).  The response of 50.3 GHz 
radiation to liquid hydrometeors is so strong that it is not, in general,  
sensitive to vertically integrated water contents exceeding (effective) rain 
rates of only a few mmh-1, at which point the liquid water path becomes 
essentially opaque to the transfer of the radiometrically cold radiation 
emitted by the ocean.  Thus, the  variability in the MSU daily rainfall 
fields is primarily related to the coverage of the grid squares by cloud 
and rain activity, not to the variations in rain intensity per se.  
Therefore, much of the accuracy of the method will depend upon a 
significant positive climatological correlation between  the true footprint-
averaged rain amount and the areal coverage of that footprint by cloud 
and rain water.<p>
	The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) has a better range 
of microwave frequencies for radiometric sensitivity to local rain 
intensity, up to rain rates of about 15 mm/hr.  Thus, the SSM/I will 
allow more accurate rain retrieval algorithms to be developed than are 
possible with the MSU.  However, even a perfect instrument would not 
be useful if it did not provide sufficient sampling of the earth.   The 
MSU provides two advantages in this regard: 50% greater spatial 
coverage than the SSM/I due to its wider swath,  and its 15 year period 
of record is the longest of any passive microwave instrument. 
<h4>	5.2.2  Rainfall errors	</h4>
<h5>	5.2.2.1  Sea ice</h5>
	Even though regions of multi-year sea ice have been largely 
screened out by restricting the oceanic rainfall dataset to 60 N-60 S,  
there remain a few regions in the dataset where seasonal sea ice occurs 
and produces false rain signatures.  These include areas near Antarctica, 
the Bering Sea, Labrador Sea, and Hudson Bay.  Users of the data in 
these regions should be aware of these false rain signatures and screen 
them out during the cold season.  We might attempt to remove these 
areas in Version 3 of the dataset.
<h5>	5.2.2.2  Climatology errors</h5>
	Small  changes to the rainfall algorithm (particularly the assumed 
slope of the channel 1 vs.  channel 2/3 15% cumulative frequency 
distribution line) have been observed to cause significant  changes in the 
annual cycle in diagnosed rainfall at high latitudes.   Thus,  there is 
inherent uncertainty in the MSU rainfall climatology, especially at high 
latitudes.  Therefore, research which examines the high-latitude annual 
cycle in MSU rainfall could be compromised until the algorithm is 
refined to correct for<p>
	As discussed by Spencer (1993), rainfall in the extratropical 
storm tracks appears to be too heavy, although there is surprisingly little 
rain gauge information with which to validate this assumption.  
Nevertheless, because of the inherent ambiguity between cloud water 
and rain water signatures, it is certainly possible that the storm track 
regions have a larger cloud/rain water ratio than other regions.
